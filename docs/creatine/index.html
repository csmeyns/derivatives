The filtrate is diluted to 150 cc. 10 cc. are pipetted into a 50 cc. volumetric flask and exactly neutralized with 2.5 N sodium hydrate solution (litmus paper). About 7.9 cc. of alkali are required for this purpose. The solution is brought to the mark by the addition of 30 cc. of saturated picric acid and water. 25 cc. of the clear filtrate are employed for the creatinine determination. The standard contains 0.1 mg. of creatinine in 5 cc. of solution; this was diluted with 15 cc. of saturated picric acid and 5 cc. of water. 1.25 cc. of 2.5 normal alkali are added to both the standard and the unknown, and ten minutes allowed for the color to develop.</p><p>The water content of the muscle was determined by noting the loss after drying to constant weight <em>in vacuo</em> over concentrated sulphuric acid and phosphorus pentoxide at room temperature.

Baumann and J.

Flask 3 contained in addition 1 gm. of arginine carbonate and Flask 4 1 gm. of methylureidoacetic acid neutralized with sodium hydroxide solution. Creatine determinations were made on the contents of Flask 1 immediately, and on the contents of Flasks 2, 3, and 4 at the end of approximately twenty-four hours at 37°. The muscle and blood were obtained from a dog just prior to the experiment. The absence of bacterial growth was demonstrated by smears and cultures.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Flask</th><th>1 (Control).</th><th>2 (Control).</th><th>3 (Arginine).</th><th>4 (Methylureidoacetic acid).</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Creatine content</td><td>64 mg.</td><td>66 mg.</td><td>66 mg.</td><td>112&ndash;50 = 62 mg.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>A previous trial showed that 1 gram of methylureidoacetic acid when subjected to the process employed for the determination of creatine in muscle produced a color equivalent to 50 mg. of creatine. Perfusion of the limb seemed to offer more nearly physiological conditions for studying the behavior of muscle tissue towards the substances in question, and an apparatus was constructed for this purpose. This apparatus is patterned after one which Brodie[^1O] has described.</p><p>The technique of perfusion was as follows: A dog was anesthetized and prepared for operation. The femoral vessels of one leg and the carotid artery were exposed, a cannula was inserted into the latter, and the dog was exsanguinated. The blood is defibrinated and filtered through cheesecloth. A measured quantity of the blood and a known volume of 0.9 per cent sodium chloride containing the substance to be perfused are well mixed. A tourniquet is placed about the limb above the point of exposure of the femoral vessels to prevent loss of fluid through the collateral vessels. The femoral vessels are then tied off and cannulas inserted. Ringer’s solution is now perfused for a short time until the fluid returns fairly colorless; this removes traces of blood which might give rise to clots and so interfere with the subsequent circulation of the perfusate. The perfusate is then placed in the receiving bottle at once and the apparatus started.</p><p>The volume of the perfusate in our experiments was usually 150 cc., but a smaller quantity may be employed. An incandescent lamp placed under the limb and a reflector above it help to supply the necessary warmth to the parts. The perfusate was supplied to the limb at a temperature of 37°. This was accomplished by immersing both the receiving and pressure bottles in a constant temperature bath. A liberal supply of oxygen was bubbled through the fluid, so that the blood to the limb was a bright red, whereas the “venous” blood was colored purplish. The pressure of the perfusate fluctuated between 80 and 140 mm. of mercury.</p><p><em>Experiment Q</em>.&mdash;The right hind leg of a dog weighing 5 kilos was perfused for one and a half hours with a mixture of 100 cc. of his own defibrinated blood and 50 cc. of 0.9 per cent sodium chloride solution containing 2 gm. of methylureidoacetic acid neutralized with ammonia. The pressure of the perfusate fluctuated between 80 and 100 mm. 95 cc. of fluid were regained. The semi-membranosus, tibialis anticus, and gastrocnemius muscles were removed from both sides and hashed immediately. 50 gm. samples were analyzed for creatine, and from 1 to 2 gm. served for the water determination. Creatine was also determined in the blood and perfusate.

<a class=anchor href=#discussion-and-conclusions>#</a></h2><p>The increase in the creatine content of the perfusate in Experiment Q is probably due to the presence of N-methylhydantoin formed from the ureido acid by heating with sulphuric acid. None of the experiments show a decided increase in the creatine content of the perfused muscle or of the perfusate.</p><p>We conclude that neither arginine nor methylureidoacetic acid, under the experimental conditions outlined above, gives rise to an <em>appreciable increase</em> in muscle creatine.</p><p>In closing we wish to express our indebtedness to Prof. J. McClintock, for his advice and assistance.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>The experimental data are taken from a dissertation submitted by J.
