<p>ON THE ORIGIN OF CREATINE.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p><font style="font-variant:small-caps">By L. BAUMANN and J. MARKER.</font></p>
<p>(<em>From the Laboratories Medicine, of the Departments State University of of Physiology and Internal Iowa, Iowa City.</em>)</p>

<p>The search for possible precursors of creatine has always led to a consideration of substances containing the guanidine radicle, as arginine and glycocyamine, or methylamino groups, as sarcosine, betaine, and choline.</p>

</p>
<p>Van Hoogenhuyze and Verploegh<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> found no increase in the elimination of creatinine, after the ingestion of proteins relatively rich in arginine. Jaffe<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> did not observe an increase in the urinary creatinine after the injection of arginine into rabbits. Thompson<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> found that the bulk (73 to 96 per cent) of the admin- istered arginine nitrogen appears as urea in the urine. Inouye<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, however, believes that an increase in creatine occurs when argin- ine is added to cat liver, or is perfused through the organ.</p>
<p>The present investigation was concerned with possible creatine formation resulting from the action of voluntary muscle on arginine and methylureidoacetic acid. The conversion of arginine into creatine would probably involve a deamination, oxidation, and methylation of the base.</p>

<p>Methylureidoacetic acid has not been found in animal tissues, but recently Ackermann<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> demonstrated the presence of its anhydride <em>N</em>-methylhydantoin among the putrefaction products of creatinine. The transformation of methylureidoacetic into methylguanidinoacetic acid would be effected by substitution of the keto oxygen by the imino group. This might possibly occur <em>in vivo</em> by reaction of the oxygen atom with ammonia.</p>
<p>The substances under investigation were placed in contact with hashed muscle and perfused through this tissue.</p>

  EXPERIMENTAL DATA AND RESULTS.
  <a class="anchor" href="#experimental-data-and-results">#</a>
</h2>
<p><small>The arginine was obtained from edestin by the method of Kossel and Kutscher.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> The pure copper nitrate salt was converted into the carbonate and this was used in our experiments.</p>
<p>The methylureidoacetic acid was prepared from sarcosine and urea<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> and employed as the sodium or ammonium salt.</p>
<p>Muscle creatine was determined according to Baumann<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>, and the creatine in the blood and perfusates by an adaptation of this method. 25 cc. of blood or perfusate are boiled for threehours under reflux with 62 cc. of 5 N sulphuric acid. The filtrate is diluted to 150 cc. 10 cc. are pipetted into a 50 cc. volumetric flask and exactly neutralized with 2.5 N sodium hydrate solution (litmus paper). About 7.9 cc. of alkali are required for this purpose. The solution is brought to the mark by the addition of 30 cc. of saturated picric acid and water. 25 cc. of the clear filtrate are employed for the creatinine determination. The standard contains 0.1 mg. of creatinine in 5 cc. of solution; this was diluted with 15 cc. of saturated picric acid and 5 cc. of water. 1.25 cc. of 2.5 normal alkali are added to both the standard and the unknown, and ten minutes allowed for the color to develop.</p>
<p>The water content of the muscle was determined by noting the loss after drying to constant weight <em>in vacuo</em> over concentrated sulphuric acid and phosphorus pentoxide at room temperature. The nitrogen was determined in 5 cc. of the muscle extract according to Kjeldahl.</small></p>
<p>L. Baumann and J. Marker</p>
<p><small><em>Experiment A</em>.&mdash;This experiment is representative of a series of similar ones. 25 gm. of hashed muscle, 25 cc. of defibrinated blood, and 10 cc. of toluene were placed in each of four flasks. Flask 3 contained in addition 1 gm. of arginine carbonate and Flask 4 1 gm. of methylureidoacetic acid neutralized with sodium hydroxide solution. Creatine determinations were made on the contents of Flask 1 immediately, and on the contents of Flasks 2, 3, and 4 at the end of approximately  twenty-four hours at 37°. The muscle and blood were obtained from a dog just prior to the experiment. The absence of bacterial growth was demonstrated by smears and cultures.</small></p>

<p>A previous trial showed that 1 gram of methylureidoacetic acid when subjected to the process employed for the determination of creatine in muscle produced a color equivalent to 50 mg. of creatine. Perfusion of the limb seemed to offer more nearly physiological conditions for studying the behavior of muscle tissue towards the substances in question, and an apparatus was constructed for this purpose. This apparatus is patterned after one which Brodie[^1O] has described.</p>
<p><small>The technique of perfusion was as follows: A dog was anesthetized and prepared for operation. The femoral vessels of one leg and the carotid artery were exposed, a cannula was inserted into the latter, and the dog was exsanguinated. The blood is defibrinated and filtered through cheesecloth. A measured quantity of the blood and a known volume of 0.9 per cent sodium chloride containing the substance to be perfused are well mixed. A tourniquet is placed about the limb above the point of exposure of the femoral vessels to prevent loss of fluid through the collateral vessels. The femoral vessels are then tied off and cannulas inserted. Ringer’s solution is now perfused for a short time until the fluid returns fairly colorless; this removes traces of blood which might give rise to clots and so interfere with the subsequent circulation of the perfusate. The perfusate is then placed in the receiving bottle at once and the apparatus started.
The volume of the perfusate in our experiments was usually 150 cc., but a smaller quantity may be employed. An incandescent lamp placed under the limb and a reflector above it help to supply the necessary warmth to the parts. The perfusate was supplied to the limb at a temperature of 37°. This was accomplished by immersing both the receiving and pressure bottles in a constant temperature bath. A liberal supply of oxygen was bubbled through the fluid, so that the blood to the limb was a bright red, whereas the “venous” blood was colored purplish. The pressure of the perfusate fluctuated between 80 and 140 mm. of mercury.</p>
<p><em>Experiment Q</em>.&mdash;The right hind leg of a dog weighing 5 kilos was perfused for one and a half hours with a mixture of 100 cc. of his own defibrinated blood and 50 cc. of 0.9 per cent sodium chloride solution containing 2 gm. of methylureidoacetic acid neutralized with ammonia. The pressure of the perfusate fluctuated between 80 and 100 mm. 95 cc. of fluid were regained. The semi-membranosus, tibialis anticus, and gastrocnemius muscles were removed from both sides and hashed immediately. 50 gm. samples were analyzed for creatine, and from 1 to 2 gm. served for the water determination. Creatine was also determined in the blood and perfusate. Nitrogen was determined the muscle extract.</small></p>

  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS.
  <a class="anchor" href="#discussion-and-conclusions">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The increase in the creatine content of the perfusate in Experiment Q is probably due to the presence of N-methylhydantoin formed from the ureido acid by heating with sulphuric acid. None of the experiments show a decided increase in the creatine content of the perfused muscle or of the perfusate.</p>
<p>We conclude that neither arginine nor methylureidoacetic acid, under the experimental conditions outlined above, gives rise to an <em>appreciable increase</em> in muscle creatine.</p>
<p>In closing we wish to express our indebtedness to Prof. J. McClintock, for his advice and assistance.</p>
