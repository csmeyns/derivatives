However, not much has been reported on the nature and the characteristics of the human origin recognition complex. In an attempt to purify recombinant human ORC from insect cells infected with baculoviruses expressing HsORC subunits, we found that human ORC2, -3, -4, and -5 form a core complex. HsORC1 and HsORC6 subunits did not enter into this core complex, suggesting that the interaction of these two subunits with the core ORC2–5 complex is extremely labile. We found that the C-terminal region of ORC2 interacts directly with the N-terminal region of ORC3. The C-terminal region of ORC3 was, however, necessary to bring ORC4 and ORC5 into the core complex. A fragment containing the N-terminal 200 residues of ORC3 (ORC3N) competitively inhibited the ORC2-ORC3 interaction. Overexpression of this fragment in U2OS cells blocked the cells in G1, providing the first evidence that a mammalian ORC subunit is important for the G1-S transition in mammalian cells.\nPrevious article in issueNext article in issue\nORC origin recognition complex GST glutathione S-transferase FACS fluorescence-activated cell sorter GFP green fluorescent protein This is an open access article under the CC BY license.\nOrigin recognition complex (ORC)4 was first described in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1). All six subunits, essential for cell viability, collectively bind to the ARS (autonomously replicating sequence) consensus sequence in a sequence-specific manner and lead to the chromatin loading of other replication factors like CDC6 and MCM (mini-chromosome maintenance) that are essential for initiation of DNA replication (2, 3). Similar six protein complexes have been discovered in Xenopus laevis(4), Drosophila melanogaster (5) and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (6), although a consensus DNA sequence that serves as an origin of replication and where ORC may bind has not been found in these species. Conservation of similar ORC subunits in mammals suggests that ORC has an equally important role in mammalian cells.\nAlthough all six human homologs of yeast S. cerevisiae ORC subunits have been reported (7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14), purification of a six-protein human origin recognition complex remains elusive. Endogenous ORC2, -3, -4, and -5 subunits have been reported to interact with each other in extracts of cancer cell lines (14). ORC1 and ORC6 did not interact with other ORC subunits under these experimental conditions (14). Therefore it is possible that a functional human ORC exists only during a very short period of the cell cycle or in a specific sub-nuclear compartment, making it difficult to extract such a complex from human cell lines. In fact, in a recent study hamster ORC1 was reported to be easily eluted from chromatin during mitosis and early G1phase (15). It became stably bound to chromatin again during mid-G1 phase with the appearance of a functional pre-replication complex at a hamster replication origin. In contrast, ORC2 was stably bound to chromatin throughout the cell cycle. Difficulties in obtaining six protein human ORCs may also be attributed to the fact that we are still missing some of the unidentified important components of the human ORC. Indeed, immunoprecipitation from [35S]methionine-labeled HeLa cell lysate of ORC1, -2, -3, -4, and -6 showed many non-ORC proteins interacting specifically with the respective ORC subunits (14, 16).\nA six protein ORC has been purified from Drosophila embryo extracts and possesses some demonstrated biochemical activities (5, 17, 18). All six Drosophila ORC subunits were expressed and subsequently purified to homogeneity from baculovirus-infected insect cells (17). Using an in vitro transcription translation reaction, a similar six-protein ORC has been reported in yeast S. pombe (6). With all the six human ORC subunits in our hand, we attempted to produce recombinant human ORC from the baculovirus expression system in order to dissect the activities and architecture of human origin recognition complex/subcomplex(s).\nBecause genetic experiments are difficult to perform in mammalian systems, the human ORC subunits have not been shown to have a role in replication or cell proliferation. Utilizing knowledge learned about the architecture of the human ORC, we created a dominant negative ORC subunit designed to disrupt the formation of endogenous ORC. Overexpression of this dominant negative ORC subunit blocked the cell cycle in G1, providing the first evidence of the importance of ORC in cancer cell proliferation.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS # Plasmid Constructions # Cloning of ORC1–6 cDNAs are described elsewhere (7, 9, 10, 11, 14). Coding sequences of ORC1, ORC4, ORC5, ORC6, and ORC3N200 were cloned into pFastBac (Life Technologies, Inc.), and coding sequences of ORC2 and ORC3 were cloned into pFastBac Dual. ORC2, -4, and -5 were also cloned in pFB-GST vectors to express GST fusion proteins. ORC3 and all the related constructs for in vitro transcription and translation reactions were made into T7T3DPAC vector (GenBank™ accession number U13871). Full-length and C-terminal ORC2 fragments were cloned into pGEX-5X-3 (Invitrogen) to produce bacterial fusion proteins. Additional information regarding the constructs will be made available upon request.\nExpression of ORC Subunits in Insect Cells, Purification, and Gel Filtration # Baculoviruses were produced from the recombinant pFastBac or pFB-GST plasmids using the Bac-to-Bac expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Hi5 or Sf9 cells (Invitrogen) were infected with these baculoviruses according to the manufacturers\u0026rsquo; recommendations. Cells were harvested 48 h post-infection. The cell pellet was washed once in cold phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2,1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 µg/ml pepstatin, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, 5 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The cell suspension was homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer using a B-type pestle followed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 7 min. The pellet containing the nuclei was lysed in buffer H/0.15 (50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mmKCl, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 µg/ml pepstatin, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, 5 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The resulting suspension was subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation (starting with 10% followed by 30% and finally 50%). The pellet after the 50% ammonium sulfate cut was resuspended in buffer H/0.0 (no salt) and then dialyzed overnight against buffer H/0.15. The dialyzed sample was then bound to GST beads (Sigma) and washed three times with buffer H/0.25. Proteins were eluted using reduced glutathione elution buffer (50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.0, 20 mm reduced glutathione, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl). Gel filtration of glutathione eluate using a fast protein liquid chromatography Superose 12 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column was performed as described previously (14).\nCell Culture, Transfection, Immunoblotting, Immunoprecipitation, and Silver Stain # Sf9 and Hi5 cells were maintained according to the manufacturers\u0026rsquo; protocol (Invitrogen). U2OS cells used for FACS analysis were maintained in Dulbecco\u0026rsquo;s modified Eagle\u0026rsquo;s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Plasmid DNA used for transfection were purified using Qiagen maxiprep kits. Cells were grown in 100-mm dishes and transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Western blotting and immunoprecipitation techniques were carried out using standard protocols. Anti-GST polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. Antibodies against HsORC1–6 have been described previously (9, 10, 11,14). The silver stain method has been described elsewhere (19).\nIn Vitro Transcription and Translation Reactions and GST Pull-down Assay # In vitro transcription and translation reactions to produce [35S]methionine-labeled full-length and different deletions of ORC3 were performed using the Promega TNT system (Madison, WI). Pull-down assays on glutathione-agarose beads were done as described previously (20).\nFACS Analysis # U2OS cells were transfected with farnesylated GFP (CLONTECH) alone or in combination with FLAGORC2, GFPC1-ORC3N, or GFPC1-ORC3C1. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were trypsinized, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with cold 70% ethanol, and stored until further use. Before analysis, fixed cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 µg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma), 10 µg/ml RNaseA (Sigma), and 0.05% Noniodet P-40 and then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Finally cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed by flow cytometry. The data were further analyzed using FLOWJO software to calculate the percentage of cells residing in different cell cycle stages.\nRESULTS # GSTORC5, -2, -3, and -4 Forms a Complex # ORC2, -3, -4, and -5 subunits have been shown to interact with each other in human cell extracts (14). In an attempt to purify recombinant six protein human origin recognition complex, we infected Sf9 insect cells with baculoviruses expressing human ORC1–6 subunits. One of the subunits, ORC5, was GST-tagged. After pull down on glutathione beads, we found that GSTORC5, -2, -3, and -4 can be purified as a complex (Fig. 1A). ORC1 did not enter into the complex in a stoichiometric ratio, and the presence of very little ORC1 in Fig. 1A was not reproducible in different preparations. ORC6 did not enter into the complex at all. Both ORC1 and ORC6 were expressed at a high level. In a control experiment, we expressed GST alone with other ORC subunits. Pull down on glutathione beads purified only GST but none of the ORC subunits. Therefore, the results in Fig. 1A are due to the formation of a complex of ORC2, -3, -4, and -5 and not due to precipitation of the proteins on the glutathione beads. GST pull-down experiments using GST tags on different ORC subunits (GSTORC2 and GSTORC4) confirmed the previous result showing ORC2, -3, -4, and -5 form a core complex (data not shown).\nDownload : Download full-size image Figure 1. Human ORC2–5 co-purify in a complex. A, Sf9 insect cells were infected with baculoviruses expressing ORC1, -2, -3, -4, -6 and GSTORC5. Proteins were purified as described under “Materials and Methods.” Both purified proteins and crude lysate (Input) were immunoblotted using ORC1–6 antibodies. B, Sf9 insect cells were infected the same way as in A using baculoviruses expressing ORC2–5 and GST as control. The cell lysate was purified on GST beads and immunoblotted. C, Sf9 insect cells were infected with baculoviruses expressing ORC2, -3, -4 and GST-ORC5. Proteins purified on GST beads were fractionated on a Superose 12 gel filtration column. Alternate fractions were immunoblotted using anti-ORC2, -3, -4 and anti-GST antibodies. The positions of the molecular mass markers thyroglobulin (670 kDa), bovine gamma globulin (158 kDa), and chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa) are shown on top. Input lanes were loaded with 5% of the total lysate passed through the column.\nTo further show that GSTORC5, -2, -3, and -4 subunits are in one complex, we analyzed the elution pattern of these proteins upon gel filtration. Proteins were eluted from the GST beads using reduced glutathione and subsequently passed through a Superose 12 gel filtration column. Upon Western blotting of different fractions with different anti-ORC antibodies, we found that GSTORC5, -2, -3, and -4 subunits were co-eluted in one fraction (Fig. 1C). The molecular mass of this complex is ∼500 kDa, which is more than the combined molecular mass of the four ORC subunits. This may be because of the multimerization of the GST moieties to give a high molecular mass complex or because the complex has an atypical shape. Silver staining of the purified protein used for the gel filtration experiment indicated that GST-ORC5, ORC2, -3, and -4 were the only proteins present in the preparation in significant amounts (Fig. 1D).\nORC2 and ORC3 Physically Interact with Each Other # We were interested in seeing which of the four interacting subunits interact directly. Sf9 insect cells were infected with six different combinations of baculoviruses expressing two ORC subunits in each case. One of the two viruses was GST-tagged. Affinity purification on glutathione beads showed that only ORC2 and ORC3 directly interacted with each other (Fig. 2). None of the other dual combinations of baculovirus showed any interaction under our experimental conditions. Therefore, we conclude that ORC2 and ORC3 form a core component of the ORC2, -3, -4, -5 complex.\nDownload : Download full-size image Figure 2. Direct interaction between ORC2 and ORC3 subunits. Sf9 insect cells were infected with six different combinations of baculoviruses expressing two ORC subunits in each case (GSTORC2-3 (GSTO2+03), GSTORC5-3 (GSTO5+03), GSTORC5-4 (GSTO5+04), GSTORC5-2 (GSTO5+02), GSTORC4-2 (GSTO4+02), and GSTORC4-3 (GSTO4+03)). Proteins bound to GST beads were immunoblotted using either anti-GST antibody or respective anti-ORC antibodies. 5% of the total lysate was loaded in the input lanes.\nORC2 and ORC3 Recruit ORC4 and -5 # The ORC2-3 complex is expected to recruit ORC4 and ORC5. We were interested in seeing whether ORC2-3 core complex can recruit ORC4 first, followed by ORC5, or vice versa. Sf9 cells were infected by baculoviruses expressing GSTORC4, -2, and -3 subunits or by viruses expressing GSTORC5, -2, and -3. GSTORC4 did not interact with ORC2 and ORC3, whereas GSTORC5 interacted with ORC2 and ORC3 (Fig. 3). Therefore, ORC2-3 core complex is capable of recruiting ORC5, but it cannot recruit ORC4 by itself. The fact that ORC2, -3, -4, and -5 form a complex suggests that ORC2, -3, and -5 complex is necessary to load ORC4. It is also possible that ORC4 and ORC5 can be loaded on ORC2-3 core complex simultaneously independent of each other, but ORC5 is necessary to stabilize the association of ORC4 with the other ORC subunits.\nDownload : Download full-size image Figure 3. ORC2-3 subcomplex can load ORC5 but not ORC4. Sf9 insect cells were infected either with baculoviruses expressing GSTORC5-2-3 (GSTORC5+2+3) or baculoviruses expressing GSTORC4-2-3 (GSTORC4+2+3). Proteins bound to GST beads were immunoblotted using either anti-GST antibodies or respective anti-ORC antibodies. Input (Inp.) lane contains 5% of proteins input on GST beads.\nN-terminal Portion of ORC3 Interacts with the C-terminal Portion of ORC2 # Upon establishing the fact that ORC2 and ORC3 form a core complex, we mapped the interacting domains of ORC2 and ORC3. N-terminal fragments of ORC3 labeled with [35S]methionine were produced by in vitro transcription and translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The proteins were incubated with bacterially expressed and purified GSTORC2 protein. Three polypeptides derived from ORC3 were capable of binding GSTORC2, whereas the control GST protein did not bind any of them (Fig. 4A). The smallest fragment that bound to ORC2 contained 200 amino acids from the N terminus of ORC3 (construct 3, ORC3N). To map the portion of ORC2 involved in the interaction with ORC3, we expressed and purified GSTORC2C, containing the C-terminal 225 amino acids of ORC2. Both full-length ORC3 and ORC3N bound to GSTORC2C (Fig. 4B), whereas control GST alone did not bind to any one of them (data not shown). Therefore, the C-terminal 225 residues of ORC2 interact with the N-terminal 200 residues of ORC3 to form the ORC2-3 complex at the core of human ORC. In the reciprocal deletion, removal of the first 200 amino acids of ORC3 abolished its ability to bind to GSTORC2 (Fig. 4C). Based on these results we conclude that N-terminal 200 residues of ORC3 are necessary and sufficient to interact with ORC2.\nDownload : Download full-size image Figure 4. Mapping domains of interactions between ORC2 and ORC3. A, full-length ORC3 or different N-terminal deletions of ORC3 were produced using in vitro transcription and translation reactions and tested for their ability to bind either GST or GSTORC2 in a pull-down experiment on glutathione-agarose beads coated with GST, GSTORC2 (GSTO2). In each case, the input lanes were loaded with 5% of the amount of the labeled protein incubated with the beads. The labeled proteins were visualized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by fluorography. B, GST pull-down experiment as in A using GSTORC2C (C-terminal portion of ORC2) and in vitro transcribed and translated full-length ORC3 (1) or ORC3N200 (3). C, full-length ORC3 or different C-terminal deletions of ORC3 were produced using in vitro transcription translation reaction. GST pull-down experiments were performed as shown in Fig. 5A using either GST or GSTORC2.\nN-terminal 200 Amino Acids of ORC3 Can Compete with the Full-length ORC3 # If the N-terminal 200 residues of ORC3 are sufficient for binding ORC2, ORC3N might be able to compete with full-length ORC3 for binding to GSTORC2. [35S]Methionine-labeled ORC3 was bound to GSTORC2 beads under conditions where the latter was limiting. These beads were then incubated with increasing amounts of ORC3N. We found that ORC3N protein could compete with the full-length ORC3 protein for association with GSTORC2 (Fig.5).\nDownload : Download full-size image Figure 5. ORC3N can compete with full-length ORC3. GSTORC2 beads were incubated with in vitro transcribed and translated full-length ORC3. After incubation, beads were thoroughly washed using binding buffer and incubated again with increasing amount of in vitro transcribed and translated ORC3N200. Beads were finally washed, and bound labeled proteins were visualized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by fluorography.\nORC3N Cannot Form a Complex That Contains ORC4-5 # Next we asked whether ORC3N is capable of mediating the interaction of ORC2 with ORC4 and ORC5. Sf9 insect cells were infected with baculoviruses expressing GSTORC5, ORC2, ORC4, and ORC3N. After affinity purification on glutathione beads and Western blotting, we confirmed the presence of GSTORC5 in the eluate from the beads. Interestingly, in contrast to the result in Fig. 1A, none of the other ORC subunits came down with GSTORC5, although they were all present in the input lane at reasonable quantities (Fig. 6A). We confirmed the physical interaction between ORC2 and ORC3N in the insect cell lysates by co-immunoprecipitation reactions. The lysate was immunoprecipitated using either anti-ORC2 or anti-ORC3 antibodies followed by immunoblotting with both the antibodies. ORC2 was detected in anti-ORC3 immunoprecipitate and vice versa (Fig. 6B). Therefore, ORC3N is capable of interacting with ORC2, but this interaction was not sufficient for further binding of ORC4 and ORC5. The C-terminal portion of ORC3 appears to be crucial for binding of ORC4 and ORC5 subunits to ORC2-3 subcomplex.\nDownload : Download full-size image Figure 6. ORC3N does not form a complex with ORC2, -4, and -5. A, Sf9 insect cells were infected with baculoviruses expressing GSTORC5, -2, -4 and ORC3N200. Proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads were immunoblotted using either anti-GST or anti-ORC antibodies. B, immunoprecipitation using anti-ORC2 and anti-ORC3 antibodies. Insect cell lysate from A was immunoprecipitated (IP) using either anti-ORC2 or anti-ORC3 antibodies followed by immunoblotting (IB) with either anti-ORC3 or anti-ORC2 antibodies. In each case 5% of the lysate (used for immunoprecipitation) was loaded in the input (Inp) lanes. Sera used for immunoprecipitation: I, immune, and PI, preimmune.\nExpression of ORC3N in U2OS Cells Causes Cell Cycle Arrest # Because ORC3N did not form a complex with ORC4 and ORC5 but still could interact with ORC2, we reasoned that ORC3N might show a dominant negative effect on the cell cycle if overexpressed in a human cancer cell line. ORC3N and ORC3C1 were cloned into GFPC1 (CLONTECH) expression vector to produce non-farnesylated GFP fusion proteins. U2OS cells were transfected with plasmids expressing farnesylated GFP alone or in combination with FLAGORC2 or GFPORC3N or GFPORC3C1 (1:3 molar ratio) followed by FACS analysis after 48 h. Cells transfected with GFP alone, FLAG-ORC2, or GFP-ORC3C1 showed normal cell cycle progression, whereas cells transfected with GFP-ORC3N were blocked mostly in G1 (73%) (Fig. 7). This is the first evidence for any cell cycle effect of any human ORC protein. Since ORC3N can still bind ORC2 but not ORC4 and ORC5, it is possible that over-expressed ORC3N interacts with ORC2 but prevents functional ORC formation. Consistent with this, over-expression of full-length ORC3, which interacts with ORC2 but allows functional ORC formation, did not block the cells in G1 (data not shown).\nDownload : Download full-size image Figure 7. FACS analysis of U2OS cells transfected with different constructs. U2OS cells were transfected either with farnesylated GFP (CLONTECH) or in combination with FLAGORC2, GFPORC3N, or GFPORC3C1. Transfected cells were fixed and stained with propidium iodide and then analyzed by FACS. The percentage of cell population present at different cell cycle stages in each transfection is shown at the bottom of the each panel.\nDISCUSSION # We report here that human ORC2, -3, -4, and -5 form a core complex in baculovirus-infected insect cells. ORC1 and ORC6 did not interact with this core complex under these experimental conditions. This was confirmed by using different tags on different ORC subunits and is consistent with our previously published data showing that endogenous ORC2, -3, -4, and -5 in a HeLa cell extract physically interacted with each other but not with ORC1 and -6(14). Recently ORC1 has been shown to interact with ORC2 by co-immunoprecipitation reaction using high salt nuclear lysate from HeLa cells (21). This study did not include ORC3-6 proteins. Unfortunately, we could not reproduce the co-immunoprecipitation of ORC1 with ORC2 in human cell lines using two different ORC1 antibodies, raised independently. Under the same conditions we still found strong interaction among ORC2–5 subunits. The data from HeLa cell extract and recombinant baculovirus proteins strongly suggest that ORC2–5 form a core complex with ORC1 and ORC6, joining the complex either at very restricted times or locations or in a very labile interaction that is easily disrupted upon cell lysis.\nWe further found that ORC2 and ORC3 form a tight complex essential for binding ORC4 and ORC5. Gel filtration of 293T cell extract showed that ORC2 and 3 were the only two subunits that mostly co-eluted, consistent with the direct interaction between ORC2 and -3 reported here (16). Under our experimental conditions, none of the other ORC subunits interact with each other directly. The N-terminal 200 amino acids of ORC3 were enough to interact with C-terminal portion of ORC2 but not sufficient to allow association with ORC4 and ORC5, suggesting that the C-terminal of ORC3 is required for ORC4 and ORC5 loading on ORC2-3 subcomplex.\nRecently, in yeast S. cerevisiae, ORC2 and ORC3 have been shown to interact directly (22). Insect cells were infected with baculoviruses expressing yeast ORCs, and recombinant yeast ORC was purified and tested for its DNA binding ability. ORC6 was found dispensable for DNA binding property. Elimination of ORC3 during baculovirus infection led to formation of ORC sub-complex without the presence of ORC2, suggesting that yeast ORC3 recruits ORC2 to the complex. Likewise, yeast ORC4 and ORC5 were shown to interact with each other. In addition, when yeast ORC was bound to yeast ARS1, ORC1, -2, -4, and -5 subunits were shown to directly contact ARS1 DNA by UV cross-linking (22). The human ORC2–5 sub-complex, however, did not show any sequence-specific DNA binding activity (data not shown).\nFinally we showed that ORC3N has a dominant negative effect on cell cycle progression. U2OS cells expressing the same fragment were blocked in G1, whereas the ORC3C1 or ORC2 protein did not prevent the cells from normal cell cycle progression. This can be explained by the fact that ORC3N titrates out ORC2 or an unknown cellular protein in the cell, thereby blocking G1-S transition. Given that ORC2 and ORC3N form a very tight complex but the latter cannot support ORC2, -3, -4, -5 complex formation, we believe that ORC2 is the target that is titrated out by ORC3N. We cannot, however, overcome the effect of ORC3N by over-expressing ORC2 or ORC2C.5 ORC2 or ORC2C might not be expressed at high enough levels to titrate out the ORC3N. Alternatively, the ORC3N targets an unknown cellular factor to cause the G1-S block.\nBased on these results we propose a molecular architecture of human ORC (Fig. 8). ORC2 and ORC3 interact directly with the C terminus of the former subunit, in close proximity with the N terminus of the latter. This binding favors the loading of ORC4 and -5 subunits via the C-terminal residues of ORC3. Although none of the other ORC subunits interacted with each other, we cannot rule out weak inter-subunit interactions among themselves. Further experiments will address how the ORC2–5 complex recruits ORC1 and ORC6 to form human ORC and study how the complex interacts with DNA.\nDownload : Download full-size image Figure 8.

The arrow with the bold line shows a strong interaction, whereas arrows with dotted lines indicate weak interactions.\nAcknowledgments # We acknowledge David Garcia Quintana, Anjali Satoshkar, and Zhi Hui Hou for making the baculovirus constructs and J.

However, Amyloid-β deposition is also found in other forms of dementia and in non-pathological contexts. Amyloid-β deposition is variable among vertebrate species and the evolutionary emergence of the amyloidogenic property is currently unknown. Evolutionary persistence of a pathological peptide sequence may depend on the functions of the precursor gene, conservation or mutation of nucleotides or peptide domains within the precursor gene, or a species-specific physiological environment.\nResults: In this study, we asked when amyloidogenic Amyloid-β first arose using phylogenetic trees constructed for the Amyloid-β Precursor Protein gene family and by modeling the potential for Amyloid-β aggregation across species in silico. We collected the most comprehensive set of sequences for the Amyloid-β Precursor Protein family using an automated, iterative meta-database search and constructed a highly resolved phylogeny. The analysis revealed that the ancestral gene for invertebrate and vertebrate Amyloid-β Precursor Protein gene families arose around metazoic speciation during the Ediacaran period. Synapomorphic frequencies found domain-specific conservation of sequence. Analyses of aggregation potential showed that potentially amyloidogenic sequences are a ubiquitous feature of vertebrate Amyloid-β Precursor Protein but are also found in echinoderm, nematode, and cephalochordate, and hymenoptera species homologues.\nConclusions: The Amyloid-β Precursor Protein gene is ancient and highly conserved. The amyloid forming Amyloid-β domains may have been present in early deuterostomes, but more recent mutations appear to have resulted in potentially unrelated amyoid forming sequences. Our results further highlight that the species-specific physiological environment is as critical to Amyloid-β formation as the peptide sequence.\nKeywords: Amyloid, Alzheimer disease, Phylogenetics, In silico, Aggregation, Maximum parsimony, Bayesian inference\nBackground # The Amyloid-β Precursor Protein (AβPP, APP) has been intensively studied due to its role in the generation of pathogenic cortical plaques in Alzheimer Disease [1]. It belongs to a gene family with deep evolutionary origins and is a member of a highly conserved protein family of type-1 transmembrane proteins [2–4]. The AβPP family consists of up to three homologues in vertebrate species: AβPP, amyloid precursor like protein 1 (APLP-1), and amyloid precursor like protein 2 (APLP-2). Invertebrate species genomes encode a single homologue referred to as either amyloid precursor like 1 protein (APL-1) or AβPP-like 1 protein (APPL-1). Vertebrates and flatworms exhibit ubiquitous expression of at least one member of the AβPP family, while fruit flies express APPL-1 only in neurons. In all species, AβPP proteins are cleaved into multiple peptides and fragments by a series of proteases, but only vertebrate AβPP contains the sequence coding the pathological Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide fragment.\nThe β-fold intrinsic to amyloid formation is a commonly observed biochemical property [5–7]. Amyloid formation is observed in non-pathological contexts from an efficient steric mechanism for storage of small peptide hormones to rudimentary forms of biological compartmentalization [5, 8]. The neuropathological changes observed in the brains of patients with Alzheimer Disease led to the formation of the Amyloid Hypothesis, which implicates both extracellular deposits of Aβ fibrils and low-order intracellular Aβ oligomers in the disruption of neuronal function, distortion of neural architecture, and induction of inflammation [1].\nMutations in the AβPP sequence and in associated proteases have been independently associated with familial early onset Alzheimer Disease characterized by rapidly progressive dementia and heavy Aβ plaque burden [9]. Recently, a protective mutation in AβPP reducing the formation of Aβ was identified [10]. However, \u0026gt;95% of sporadic Alzheimer Disease exhibits no mutation in the AβPP gene sequence. Further, deposition of Aβ is not limited to Alzheimer Disease. Aβ plaques have been observed in vascular dementias, Lewy body dementia, and Parkinson Disease with dementia, as well as in the brains of aged individuals without any cognitive deficits [11–14]. Together, these studies indicate that while the sequence of Aβ can contribute to the progression and severity of disease factors regulating the production by proteolysis and the degradation and clearance of Aβ, it also plays a critical role in generation of Aβ pathology.\nBeyond the eponymous production of Aβ, AβPP processing produces other active peptides with functions ranging from hemostatic modulators to trophic factors to pro-apoptotic proteins [15–18]. There is a substantial body of knowledge focusing on the neural impacts of AβPP and Aβ. However, this family of proteins is also widely expressed in peripheral tissues of vertebrate species including skin, skeletal muscle, leukocytes, platelets, intestinal epithelia, pancreas, and adipose tissue. The function and regulation of non-neuronal AβPP are not fully understood [19–26].\nThe AβPP family is variably essential for viability among species. Experimental data show that the N-terminus of APL-1 is necessary for progression through molting stages by nematodes [27]. The C-terminus of at least one member of the AβPP family is necessary for viability in early parturition of knockout mouse models [28–30]. Drosophila models without APPL-1 show subtle neuronal patterning defects but remain viable and able to reproduce [31]. Zebrafish knockout models have impaired body development and synaptogenesis [32, 33]. Each of these models can be rescued by expression of truncated portions of AβPPs, indicating that absences of different domains are responsible for the observed lethality or defects in each model. Thus, the persistence of this protein family appears domain-dependent among species despite high evolutionary conservation of the entire gene.\nThe major conserved regions found in AβPP family proteins include two ectoplasmic domains (E1 and E2), which contain extracellular matrix and divalent cation binding regions and a growth-factor-like domain (GFLD), and the cytoplasmic region (E3) that contains a basolateral sorting signal (BLS) and an NPXY internalization sequence (YENPTY) (Figure 1). The corresponding nucleic acids coding the domains are termed D1, D2, and D3, respectively. Other important conserved domains include a Kunitz-protease inhibitor (KPI) domain found only in vertebrate AβPP and APLP-2, as well as the βA4 region that gives rise to Aβ in certain vertebrate species. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that the corresponding region of APPL-1 in Drosophila melanogaster can form amyloid deposits when co-expressed in high levels with the Drosophila β-secretase [34]. Similar to the conservation of the E1, E2, and E3 domains, the βA4 region and corresponding regions may have arisen from a common ancestral domain [35]. It is not known when the amyloidogenic trait first appeared in this gene family nor why species with nearly identical Aβ sequences do not develop Aβ deposits.\nfigure1\nFigure 1 Conserved Regions of the Amyloid-β Precursor Protein Gene Family. Schematic representations of the five members of the Amyloid-β Precursor Protein (AβPP) gene family show multiple conserved domains: N-Terminal Signal peptide (NTS), growth factor-like domain (GFLD), heparin binding domain (Hep), copper binding domain (Cu), zinc binding domain (Zn), an acidic amino-acid rich region (D/E), collagen binding domain (Col), a basolateral sorting signal (BLS), and a clathrin-binding internalization signal domain (YENPTY). Certain members of the gene family also contain a Kunitz-protease inhibitor domain (KPI), the amyloid-β forming region (βA4), an OX-2 domain (diagonal hashmarks), a putative collagen binding domain (horizontal white hashmarks), and/or a glutamine and serine-rich region (Q/S).\nFull size image\nPrevious phylogenetic studies showed that this ancient protein family has been widely distributed among multicellular eukaryotes since at least the divergence of protostomia and deuterostomia [36]. These studies and corresponding conclusions are based on at most ten sequences that were trimmed and concatenated, focusing solely on the major conserved domains (D1, D2, and D3 only). Use of trimmed sequences does yield cleaner sequence alignments and better branch supports on the phylogenetic tree, but ignores potentially valuable evolutionary data encoded in adjoining regions. For the AβPP gene family in particular, the omission of Aβ from the analyses occludes an understanding of the evolution of the pathological eponymous domain. Despite wide distribution of the AβPP family across species, it is not know when amyloidogenic Aβ peptides first evolved. This study uses the full complement of available molecular sequence data to provide an in silico model of the evolutionary history of this essential gene family and the origin of the Aβ peptide.\nResults # Phylogenetics of AβPP gene family # Amino acid and nucleotide sequences were collected using an automated, iterative search method from Entrez Protein (GenPept) and Entrez Nucleotide (GenBank) (see Methods and Additional file 1: Table S1). Character matrices were generated in Mesquite 2.75 and aligned using Muscle 3.8.31) and the longest sequence for each species’ homologue(s) was retained [37, 38]. Amino acid and nucleotide trees were generated under maximum parsimony using TNT 1.1 and Bayesian inference using MrBayes 3.2 [39, 40].\nThe overall topology of the nucleotide and amino acid trees is similar among trees generated by maximum parsimony (Figure 2a and b) and Bayesian inference (Additional file 1: Figure S1a and b). Branch support data for the Bayesian analyses are found in Additional file 1: Figure S1 and support for the maximum parsimony analyses are found in Additional file 1: Figure S2.\nfigure2\nFigure 2 Phylogenetic Relationships of 103 members of the Amyloid-β Precursor Protein Gene Family. Shown are: (a) Phylogram showing the evolutionary relationships among the nucleotide sequences of the AβPP gene family; (b) Phylogram for the corresponding protein sequences. Trees were generated by maximum parsimony methods. Scale bars indicate character changes contributing to branch lengths.\nFull size image\nThe presence of an AβPP-like sequence in hydra (Hydra magnipapillata) and sea anemone (Nematostella vectensis) genomes suggests that the ancestral gene arose around metazoic divergence in the Ediacaran period, between 630–540 million years ago (Mya). No related sequences from single-celled organisms were found. A single member of the gene family has persisted across invertebrate species with a major divergence around the evolution of arthropods during the Cambrian period giving rise to APPL-1 (~500 Mya). Two gene duplication events occurred during the evolution of vertebrate species. Our search recovered a single AβPP-like gene for the cephalochordate lancelet (Branchiostomidae floridae) genome that was more closely related to mollusks and cnidarians than vertebrate sequences. The cartilaginous ray (Narke japonica) genome contains a single AβPP gene with high homology to human AβPP. The results indicate that AβPP and APLP-2 genes are present in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) but only AβPP was recovered for other members of class Osteichthyes (Takifugu rubripes, Tetraodon fluviatilis, and Perca flavescens). The majority of tetrapod genomes in this study contained all three members of the vertebrate AβPP gene family. Sequences for all three genes were found for Xenopus species, but APLP-1 sequences were not found for any members of class Aves or Reptilia.\nWithin the gene family, the nucleotide sequence phylogenetic trees (Figure 2a) indicate that AβPP and APLP-2 are more closely related than APLP-1 and APLP-2. Furthermore, the placement in the nucleotide phylogenetic tree suggests that APLP-1 may be the original vertebrate sequence. However, placement of the AβPP branch on the nucleotide tree is weakly supported under both maximum parsimony (47% resampling support, 12% relative Bremer; see Additional file 1: Figure S2a, b) and Bayesian inference (60% posterior probability; see Additional file 1: Figure S1a). In the amino acid sequence phylogenetic trees, APLP-1 and APLP-2 are more closely related and AβPP appears to be the original vertebrate peptide (Figure 2b). This arrangement has higher support for the placement of AβPP (65% resampling support, 100% relative Bremer support [maximum parsimony] Additional file 1: Figure S2c, d; 100% posterior probability [Bayesian inference]; Additional file 1: Figure S1b).\nPersistence of amyloid-β # The variability in the essential nature of the AβPP gene family can be observed by analyzing the evolutionary differences between related genes and shared residues according to specific functional domains. This was accomplished using synapomorphy frequency histograms. A synapomorphy is a trait or character shared by sister taxa of a clade that was derived from a previous common ancestor but not shared by taxa from another clade. Thus, synapomorphies contribute to the topology of a phylogenetic tree as factors in defining nodes on the tree [41]. Using the TNT program we collected synapomorphies present at each node of the consensus amino acid tree and examined the frequency of synapomorphy for each character across the sequence matrix. High frequencies of synapomorphy indicate residue changes at a given position make large contributions to the topology of the phylogenetic tree (conversely, low frequencies on the plots are associated with highly conserved domains/characters present in all terminal taxa groupings on the tree).\nIn this study, synapomorphies were first analyzed across all positions in the dataset (Figure 3) and then analyses were stratified by the major branches corresponding to APPL-1, APL-1, AβPP, APLP-2, and APLP-1 (Figure 4, Tables 1 and 2). The most highly variable region was the E2 domain, which accounted for 18.3% of synapomorphies on the whole tree, while the most highly conserved domain was the E3 domain (which had 6.9% of the residue synapomorphies). The E3 region of AβPP, encoded by exons 17 and 18, contributed 1.7% of the synapomorphic frequencies to that branch and 0.3% for the whole tree. By contrast, the same region of the other homologues contributed between 1.2 – 2.4% for the whole tree and 6.3 – 12.5% for each major branch. The βA4 domain, encoded by exons 16 and 17, contributed 0.5% and 3.1% of synapomorphies to the whole tree and AβPP branch, respectively. The exon 16–17 regions of APLP-1 and APLP-2 contributed 1.5% and 1% of synapomorphies to the whole tree, respectively, and 8.8% and 5.4% to their respective branches. These data showed the E3 region to be the most highly conserved part of the entire gene family and conservation of the βA4/E3 region is even stronger for vertebrate species.\nfigure3 Figure 3 Synapomorphic Character Frequencies for the Amyloid-β Precursor Protein Gene Family.

The Guinea pig rodent (Cavia porcelus) and the common hare (Oryctolagus cuniculus) have been shown to generate Aβ plaques, but neither the Mus musculus nor Rattus norvegicus rodents naturally produce Aβ plaques [45–48]. Evidence of Aβ accumulation in other vertebrate species is sparse. Deposition of extracellular Aβ has only been documented in one member of class Osteichthyes: Onchyrus sockeye salmon; the sockeye AβPP gene has not been sequenced [49]. While some species of birds may generate Aβ plaques or vascular amyloid deposition, there is no evidence of plaque formation or extracellular deposition in reptiles and amphibians despite \u0026gt;90% sequence homology [47, 50]. No natural invertebrate amyloid-β plaques have been documented. Recently it was shown that the corresponding peptide from Drosophila can form an amyloid in vivo when co-expressed at high levels with the endogenous β-secretase gene [34].\nIn order to determine when Aβ formation first arose in evolution, we modeled β-sheet aggregation and amyloid formation probabilities for sequences corresponding to the human βA4 region using the AmylPred tool and PASTA server, both of which have been designed and validated using Aβ [51–54]. We found the C-terminal region of βA4 domains to have a high probability to form an amyloid or aggregate for nearly all sequences (Figures 5, 6, and 7). Only sequence from the silkmoth Bombyx mori had no amyloidogenic potential using both methods, although AmylPred predicted amyloidogenicity in a short C-terminal region. Very few sequences with amyloidogenic potential were found in the N-terminal region of invertebrate βA4 domains. The cnidarian sea anemone Nematostella vectensis and hydra Hydra magnipapillata exhibit strong C-terminal amyloid potential but little potential for amyloid formation in their N-terminal βA4 (Figure 6a and b). The nematode Trichinella spiralis is the only worm in our dataset with strongly amyloidogenic βA4 N-terminal sequences predicted by both methods (Figure 6d). The Neohelice granulata crab has a short N-terminal amyloid prone region (Figure 6e), but the water flea Daphnia pulex does not (Figure 6f). The Drosophila flies all express a potentially amyloidogenic N-terminal sequence predicted by AmylPred but with a PASTA energy of – 3.01 (Figure 6g), but no other members of Hymenoptera express amyloid prone sequence at the N-terminus. The squid Loligo pealei has PASTA energies \u0026lt; − 4 for long stretches of the N-terminal βA4 region but no consensus support from AmylPred (Figure 6i). The sea slug Aplysia californica has a short region with probable amyloid forming potential supported by AmylPred and with a PASTA energy of – 3.16 (Figure 6j). The sea urchins Stronglyocentrotus purpuratus and Paracentrotus lividus also had a short N-terminal region predicted to form amyloid (Figure 6k). The cephalochordate lancelet Branchiostoma floridae had two long N-terminal regions with high amyloidogenic potential (Figure 6l). All AβPP sequences in the dataset exhibited a strongly amyloidogenic N-terminal region, though the rodent M musculus and R novergicus sequences had reduced PASTA energies compared to other vertebrates for their N-terminal regions (Figures 5 and 7). Interestingly, Danio rerio APLP2 showed an N-terminal amyloidogenic region (Figure 7e) while all other APLP2 sequences were identical at these residues and had a lower probability of forming an amyloid (Figure 7f). The APLP1 sequences for Xenopus laevis and Monodelphis domestica showed long sections of aggregation prone sequence (Figure 7g and h). The remaining APLP1 sequences, representing only placental mammals, show a region with lowered probability of aggregation or fibril formation (Figure 7i).\nFigure 5 (See legend on next page.)\n(See figure on previous page.)\nFigure 5 figure5 Amyloidogenic Potential in the Amyloid-β Sequence.

The analysis reveals that the ancestral sequence evolved during metazoic divergence, which is much earlier than previously thought. The results further suggest that AβPP itself was the first vertebrate sequence and that APLP-1 and 2 are likely derived from gene duplication of AβPP.\nIt is possible that the vertebrate gene family arose as a duplication of APLP-1 followed by a second duplication to form APLP-2 and AβPP. However, it is also possible that the original duplication gave rise to APLP-2 and AβPP after which a duplication of APLP-2 gave rise to APLP-1. The search strategy used in this study found APLP-1 sequences only in tetrapods, AβPP in both cartilaginous and bony fish, and APLP-2 in one bony fish and most tetrapods.\nWe found that the E3 C-terminal region of the protein is essentially unchanged since the divergence of jawed vertebrates during the Ordovician period and that amyloidogenic Aβ was present around this evolutionary step. Its persistence is likely due to the overlap with the E3 domain. It has been shown that the E3 domain is essential for life in mammals and the βA4 domain contains an HD motif with evidence of positive selection, both of which may explain some of the persistence of amyloidogenic Aβ in the mammalian genome [30, 35]. Our analysis also found evidence of aggregation prone C-terminal regions in nearly all sequences in the dataset, which is not surprising as this is part of the transmembrane region high in hydrophobic residues, but a stable β-fold requires two regions within the peptide. Sequences with two separate domains capable of forming and stabilizing an amyloid were rare in protostomes, suggesting the characteristic developed after the divergence of deuterostomes and protostomes or was subsequently lost through mutation (Figure 8). Of particular note, the Drosophila sequence is predicted to form an amyloid but at a lowered probability than mammalian Aβ and there is experimental evidence that it can form fibrillar Aβ in vivo [34]. As no other Hymenoptera species in the study show amyloid potential, this likely represents a new mutation in the development of the fruitfly species. Interestingly, non-vertebrate deuterostome species in this study have amyloidogenic sequence but little homology to the mammalian Aβ sequence, suggesting that early amyloid prone regions may have evolved prior to the divergence of echinoderms, hemichordate, and chordate species. The main sequence variations arise from the N-terminal region aligned to Homo sapiens AβPP exon 16. APLP-2 from the zebrafish Danio rerio also showed amyloidogenic potential and all other APLP-2 had reduced potential to form Aβ. This is may be a result of mutation or indels in the exon 16 region during or after the gene duplication events giving rise to APLP-1 and APLP-2.\nFigure 8 (See legend on next page.)\n(See figure on previous page.)

Species with unique sequences demonstrating potential for Amyloid-β formation are labeled. Full size image\nBecause the data used in this study were based on in silico search strategies from deposited sequences in public repositories (GenBank and GenPept), it cannot be assumed that these data are necessarily complete for each species (i.e., a de novo sequencing was not performed for each species studied). Nonetheless, these data support the hypotheses that AβPP is the ancestral sequence for vertebrates, gene duplication after the speciation of cartilaginous and bony fish gave rise to APLP-2, and a subsequent partial or degenerate duplication of APLP-2 following the speciation of tetrapods gave rise to APLP-1. Some species may have subsequently lost either APLP-1 or APLP-2 genes.\nThe sequence difference in Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus results from three amino acid substitutions from three single nucleotide changes. Whether the lack of amyloidogenesis in these particular rodents comes from these three changes or from other physiological considerations is unclear, but the presence of identical sequence in other rodents and mammals in general suggests that the ancestral species to mice and rats evolved around amyloidogenic Aβ. The lack of data on Aβ deposition in fish, birds, reptiles, and amphibians also suggests unknown physiological adaptations may limit Aβ production or deposition. Recently a mutation encoding a change from alanine to threonine at position 673 of AβPP was found to be protective against developing Alzheimer Disease, likely through reduction of β-secretase processing at that site [10]. It is interesting to note that all fish sequences in this study, with the exception of Danio rerio, have a threonine at this position, suggesting β-secretase processing may be reduced in these animals. In addition to processes that may increase or decrease Aβ production by regulating secretase efficiency or transcription, the presence of a β-secretase in the gene repertoire is an important consideration.\nA whole genome assembly for Nematostella vectensis indicate the presence of the secretases but no studies have examined amyloid formation [55]. A genome for Hydra magnipapillata predicted the presence of a γ-secretase, but not a β-secretase (REFSEQ NW_002165109). Experimental evidence suggests that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans does not express a β-secretase, although both α- and γ-secretases have been identified [56]. A search of Entrez Nucleotide returned no β-secretase sequences for other nematodes, crustaceans, hymenoptera, or lepidoptera in our dataset.\nThe increased understanding of disease genetics and increasing availability of molecular sequence data provide an opportunity to harness evolutionary approaches to provide deep insights pertaining to the etiology of disease. Using this approach we found the AβPP family to have origins in the speciation of the metazoic lineage and propose that ancestral Aβ may have arisen as deuterostomia and protostomia diverged. However, other mutations may continue to produce amyloidogenic sequences in this domain, as seen with Drosophila or unknown physiological factors may play a role in preventing Aβ formation as in mice and rats. The approach developed here may be widely applicable to the study of other critical disease genes and builds a foundation for further studies on the co-evolution of Alzheimer Disease associated proteins (e.g., co-evolution of ApoE or β-secretase with AβPP) that may yield novel approaches to treating or preventing Aβ formation.\nMethods # Dataset collection and alignment # Amino acid sequences were collected through Entrez Protein using a combination of search terms and sequence similarity searches. First, based on previous studies of sequences from the Amyloid-β Precursor Protein [2–4, 36] family five sets of metadata-based search terms developed and used to identify those sequences from across the Amyloid-β Precursor Protein family: (1) \u0026quot;App\u0026quot;[gene name] AND \u0026quot;animals\u0026quot;[porgn:__txid33208]; (2) \u0026quot;aplp1\u0026quot;[gene name] and \u0026quot;animals\u0026quot;[porgn:__txid33208]; (3) \u0026quot;aplp2\u0026quot;[gene name] and \u0026quot;animals\u0026quot;[porgn:__txid33208]; (4) \u0026quot;apl-1\u0026quot;[gene name] and \u0026quot;nematodes\u0026quot;[porgn:__txid6231]; and (5) \u0026quot;app_amyloid\u0026quot;. Sequences for which the organism was either “Unknown” or listed as a “synthetic construct” were removed. Next, a stringent (E-value = 0.0) blastp (BLAST+ v.2.2.26) was used to search Entrez Protein for potential orthologous amino acid sequences for each of the sequences identified in the metadata-based search from the non-redundant protein database. An additional stringent blastp search was then done iteratively for each new sequence identified, until no additional sequences were found. The resulting dataset (which contained 435 sequences) was then subjected to multiple sequence alignment using MUSCLE v.3.8.31 [38]. The multiple sequence alignment was manually inspected (by viewing the data in Mesquite 2.75 [37]) to identify the one longest representative sequence per taxon (e.g., only the sequence for human AβPP770 which contains all transcribed and translated exons was kept). As sequences were removed from the dataset, the multiple sequence alignment was redone. The resulting dataset reflected 103 taxa corresponding to 67 species. Based on identifiers within GenPept records, corresponding nucleic acid sequences were then collected for each amino acid sequence. These nucleotide sequences were also subjected to multiple sequence alignment using MUSCLE. Character maps were generated using the Mesquite character matrices.\nGeneration of phylogenetic trees # Trees were obtained by maximum parsimony using TNT 1.1 and Bayesian inference using MrBayes 3.2.0 [39, 40]. For analyses in TNT, the ‘aquickie.run’ script was used to guide the search, which aimed to find the optimal score 20 times independently, using defaults of \u0026ldquo;xmult\u0026rdquo; plus 10 cycles of tree-drifting. This resulted in 131 nucleotide trees from more than 8x108 rearrangements and 103714 amino acid trees from more than 7x108 rearrangements. For consensus tree calculation, trees were TBR-collapsed, Bremer group supports calculated by TBR-swapping, and bootstrap resampling by 100 replications of symmetric resampling with a single random addition (see Additional file 1).\nFor MrBayes, the Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis was set for 2 runs with 4 chains each with a temperature of 0.2 degrees. A General Time Reversible (GTR) model with a Dirichlet (flat) probability distribution of nucleotide rate change parameters, stationary nucleotide frequencies, no specified shape parameter for the gamma distribution of rate variation, and no invariable sites was used for the nucleotide analyses; this is the default prior model for nucleotide matrices in MrBayes. All runs favored the WAG rate matrix as the prior model for the amino acid analyses [57].\nMarkov Chain analysis was continued until the runs converged, when the standard deviation of the split frequencies remained \u0026lt;0.01 and likelihood analysis found the potential scale reduction factor approached 1.0 [58]. For the nucleotide modeling this took more than 3x106 generations; for the protein analysis this took more than 2x106 generations. Consensus trees were constructed using the 50% majority rule with 95% cumulative posterior probability from 925 nucleotide trees and 1,591 amino acid trees (see Additional file 1). All tree diagrams were generated in either Dendroscope 3.1.0 or FigTree 1.3.1 [59, 60].\nSynapomorphic frequencies # Unambiguous synapomorphies at each node were generated in TNT for the maximum parsimony consensus trees. The frequency of a given character being synapomorphic at a given node was examined for the entire amino acid tree and for each of the five major branches. Probabilistic models of synapomorphy have been developed to address the confounding of homoplasy and lend statistical support to defining a character as synapomorphic as opposed to homoplasious [41]. While these are important considerations for higher resolution analysis of a gene family, use of simple statistical analysis for such a large and diverse dataset is a reasonable approach to defining areas of conservation or change, accepting internal error for random mutation producing homoplasy or loss of an actual synapomorphy.\nAggregation modeling # There are a number of programs available for modeling β-folding and aggregation of amyloidogenic peptides [61]. AmylPred is a consensus tool that predicts β-folding and aggregation based on a set of five published methods and uses agreement of 2 or more methods for determining consensus [54]. PASTA predicts stabilizing sequences in β-fibrillar structures using a calculation of the change of energy from pairing between amino acid sequences [53]. Regions that are known to form ordered β-fibril structures have a PASTA energy less than – 4. Using aligned amino acid sequences coded by Homo sapiens AβPP exons 16 and 17, we examined the corresponding βA4 region across all taxa and used known secretase cleavage sites to determine the aligned sequences for submission to AmylPred and PASTA [62–64]. Where cleavage sites are not known from previous studies, boundaries were chosen based on similar species and sequences. In cases where there was no clear similarity, boundaries were extended to correspond with Homo sapiens Aβ42. PASTA energies were collected until greater than – 2 by sequential truncation of the C-terminus for each sequence.

ARTICLE INFO # Handling Editor: Dr. Aristidis Tsatsakis\nKeywords: # Cell line Human Heavy metal Arsenic Cadmium Chromium Metabolic pathway\nAbstract # Various anthropogenic and natural events over the years have gradually increased human exposure to various heavy metals. Several of these heavy metals including cadmium, mercury, nickel, chromium, and the metalloid arsenic among others, have created major public health concerns for their high level of toxicities. Identification of the general as well as the differentially affected cellular metabolic pathways will help understanding the molecular mechanism of different heavy metal-induced toxicities. In this study, we analyzed 25 paired (control vs. treated) transcriptomic datasets derived following treatment of various human cells with different heavy metals and metalloid (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, iron, mercury, nickel and vanadium) to identify the affected metabolic pathways. The effects of these metals on metabolic pathways depend not only on the metals per se, but also on the nature of the treated cells. Tissue of origin, therefore, must be considered while assessing the effects of any particular heavy metal or metalloid. Among the metals and metalloid, arsenic appears to have relatively more pleiotropic influences on cellular metabolic pathways including those known to have association with diabetes. Although only two stem cell derived datasets are included in the current study, effects of heavy metals on these cells appear to be different from other mature cells of similar tissue origin. This study provides useful information about different heavy metal affected pathways, which may be useful in further exploration using wet-lab based techniques.\nGraphical abstract # Download : Download high-res image (142KB)Download : Download full-size image\nReceived 23 December 2020; Received in revised form 27 May 2021; Accepted 28 May 2021 Available online 31 May 2021 2214-7500/© 2021 The Author(s).

Introduction # Heavy metals are natural elements characterized by their high atomic weights and specific gravities greater than five [1,2]. Arsenic, which is a metalloid, has a high specific gravity as well. Several of the heavy metals and metalloids, in particular, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, mercury and nickel, among others have created major public health concerns for their high level of toxicities [1,[3], [4], [5], [6]]. Humans are exposed to these heavy metals through anthropogenic activities such as mining and smelting operations together with industrial, agricultural, and domestic use of metals and metal-containing compounds [3,7]. The major sink for the heavy metals released into the environment is soil, where these accumulate over time without undergoing extensive chemical or microbial degradation [8]. These can enter the human body through skin, by inhalation, and through the intake of contaminated food and water [[9], [10], [11]]. Heavy metal mediated toxicity occurs when chronic or acute exposure to a heavy metal exceeds certain threshold levels in the body [12]. Toxicity may result from the interactions of heavy metals with biomolecules like DNA and proteins, and thus modulating important cellular pathways [1]. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated due to heavy metal exposure may cause cellular damage in different organs including liver, brain and kidney [1,13].\nArsenic is the 20th most abundant element on earth’s crust [14] and well known as one of the few metals and metalloids that can cause large-scale adverse health effects [12]. Over 140 million people in more than 70 countries around the globe are facing chronic exposure to arsenic through ground water at levels higher than the maximum permissible limit of 10 μg/L set by the World Health Organization (WHO) [15,16]. In Bangladesh, an estimated 35–77 million people have been facing chronic exposure to arsenic through drinking water and food crops- an incident which is dubbed as “the largest mass poisoning of a population in history” [17]. Chronic arsenic toxicity or arsenicosis has previously been associated with skin lesions and cancers of the skin, bladder, lung, kidney, liver, and colon [[18], [19], [20], [21], [22]].\nCadmium (Cd) is another non-essential heavy metal that poses significant health risks to human. Chronic exposure to cadmium leads to systemic toxicity and cancers in the lung, breast, prostate, nasopharynx, pancreas, and kidney [23,24]. The liver and kidneys are extremely sensitive to cadmium toxicity [24,25]. This heavy metal also poses a risk of osteoporosis [24,25]. Exposure to cadmium occurs primarily through the intake of contaminated drinking water, fruits, grains, leafy vegetables and to a considerable extent through cigarette smoking and inhalation [18,24]. More than the maximum permissible limits (0.003 mg/L) of cadmium [12] in drinking water have been reported in countries including Pakistan [26], Nigeria [27], Sweden [28], and Saudi Arabia [29]. Accumulated cadmium in the body typically has a long half-life of about 25–30 years [24]. Although it is a natural element, humans are mostly exposed to cadmium through agricultural and industrial sources [28,30].\nChromium in small amount is an essential element for normal metabolic functions. However, at high concentrations this heavy metal, especially in the hexavalent form (Cr (VI)), it is toxic and carcinogenic [31]. Cr (VI) can form Cr-DNA adduct which can lead to mutation and chromosomal breakage [32]. Chronic inhalation of Cr (VI) affects the respiratory tract [33] and can lead to the development of lung cancer [34] in human. Studies on animal model have shown that long-term chromium exposure can lead to oxidative stress and immunotoxicity [35]. Adverse effects on reproductive organs and reduced fertility was observed as a result of chronic chromium exposure in both male and female mice [36].\nOther heavy metals like mercury, nickel, vanadium, etc also have adverse effects on human health. Human exposure to mercury occurs through inhalation of elemental (metallic) mercury vapor via industrial practices, dental amalgam or ingestion of organic mercury compounds (methyl, dimethyl, or ethyl mercury) primarily through consumption of contaminated fish [37]. Mercury affects functions of the renal, endocrine, immune and peripheral nerve systems [37,38]. Children are more susceptible and vulnerable to the harmful effects of mercury than the adults [38]. Methylmercury may even cross the placenta and cause harm to the developing fetus in pregnant woman [37,38]. Nickel is an immunotoxin and carcinogen [39]. Depending on the dose and length of exposure, nickel can cause allergic reaction and toxicity in the respiratory tract, kidney, lung and immune system [39]. Although vanadium is an element with beneficial effects on humans and holds therapeutic potential in treating diabetes, excessive exposure can cause gastrointestinal problems along with hepato- and nephrotoxicities [40]. Frydas et al. [41] studied gene expression in animal model following exposure to particulate matters (PM) in the air. These particulate matters included various metals and metalloids including V, Zn, As, Pb, Mn, Ni, Cd, Cr and Fe at much lower concentration compared to the concentrations usually exposed through consumption of food, water and air in areas contaminated with heavy metals. Even at the very low concentrations, these metal containing air influenced expression of genes associated with inflammatory response, cell cycle and carcinogenicity [41].\nIn this study, we used in silico tools to analyze 25 global gene expression datasets (comprised of 174 global gene expression profiles in total) of control vs. metal/ metalloid (As, Cd, Cr, Fe, Hg, Ni and V) treated cells of human origin to explore the metabolic pathways that are affected following exposure to arsenic and other heavy metals.\n2. Methods and materials # 2.1. Data sources and pre-processing # 25 paired global gene expression datasets (control vs. metal treated) from 13 studies in which different human cells (HepG2, MCF7, UROtsa, BEAS-2B, HepaRG, NPrEC and human dermal fibroblasts) were exposed to arsenic, cadmium, chromium, mercury, nickel, iron, and vanadium were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database [42] (Table 1). These studies used different gene expression analysis platforms (Table 1). Other relevant information, such as the form and concentration of the heavy metals used, procedure and duration of exposure to heavy metals, etc are given in Table 1. To avoid the limitations associated with cross-platform data normalization and comparison and reduce ambiguity in the interpretation, we used GEO2R from NCBI GEO to select the top 250 most significantly differentially expressed genes within each paired datasets. Data were filtered at two different levels. First, only those samples that showed comparable median-centered data were included in the analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1). Second, from these samples, only the genes (from the top 250) that had differential gene expression level with false discovery rate (FDR) \u0026lt; 0.05 were selected for further analysis.\nTable 1.

Metabolic pathway analysis # The filtered list of genes from each paired dataset was used as an input into the NetworkAnalyst platform [43] and pathways associated with these genes were identified by network enrichment analysis (over representation analysis or ORA) based on the data available in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database [44]. Only the pathways with p \u0026lt; 0.05 were selected for further analysis. Presence or absence of each of these pathways in different datasets was digitized with 1 (for presence) and 0 (for absence). These gene expression derived pathway data were scrutinized by partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). These datasets were assorted in different combinations to identify the different class specific (depending on the cell line and metals) distinguishing pathways using the PLS-DA Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) scores.\n3. Results and discussion # 3.1. Pathways that are affected by particular heavy metals irrespective of the cell lines # Irrespective of their tissue of origin, a particular heavy metal treated cell lines tend to cluster together (Fig. 1A). The affected metabolic pathways, however, appear also to be dependent on the heavy metals, which is evident from distribution of different heavy metal treated cells along different axes in the plot (Fig. 1A). Since there was one dataset for each of Fe, Hg and V treatments, these were placed in a single group in the analysis. PLS-DA is a supervised method of multivariate analysis that, in addition to the variances in data, takes into account the class information during the clustering process. Although the class information leads to some level of biasness in the clustering process, this information actually adds benefit in analyses like this where the objective is to identify the features that are responsible for differences between defined groups or clusters.\nFig. 1 Download : Download high-res image (906KB)Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1.

Heavy metal affected pathways based on the PLS-DA VIP scores.\nFig. 1B shows the pathways that are overly represented in different heavy metal treated cells irrespective of their tissue of origin. Arsenic appears to have the most drastic effect on cellular metabolic pathways. Arsenic and cadmium both affect the expression of genes involved in the PPAR signaling pathway and thyroid hormone biosynthesis. PPARγ plays role in insulin sensitization and is the master regulator of adipogenesis [45,46]. Arsenic also affects the expression of the genes involved in porphyrin metabolism, fat digestion and absorption, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, steroid biosynthesis and pentose phosphate pathway (Fig. 1B). Previous studies on arsenic or cadmium mediated toxicities on human and other model organisms also reported several of these affected pathways. For example, multiple studies in the recent years reported diabetogenic effects of arsenic [[47], [48], [49]]. Arsenic-mediated down-regulation of PPARγ in hepatic tissues is involved with the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [50]. Perturbation of PPARγ may also be one of the contributory factors to the carcinogenicity of arsenic [51]. Cadmium inhibits adipocyte differentiation by down-regulating PPARγ [52] and affects placental PPARγ-associated pathway [53]. In addition, cadmium-mediated abnormal adipocyte differentiation, expansion and function, along with hampered insulin signaling may cause insulin resistance, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases [54,55]. High fat diet, an independent factor for development of metabolic syndromes, also increases cadmium accumulation in several organs including testes in cadmium exposed male mice, resulting in increased infertility [56]. Both arsenic and cadmium are involved in PPARγ-dependent apoptosis of rat astrocytes [57]. In addition, both the heavy metal and metalloid can disrupt endocrine regulations [58]. Chronic and combined administration of high fat diet and arsenic reduces production of thyroid hormones in mice [59]. In human, arsenic affects functioning of the thyroid hormone [60,61] as it interferes with thyroid hormone receptor-mediated gene expression regulation [62]. Accumulation of cadmium in the thyroid gland reduces the synthesis of thyroid hormones in both humans and animals [63]. Exposure to cadmium can also result in the development of thyroid cancer [64]. Pentose and glucuronate interconversion pathway is over-represented in arsenic, cadmium, iron, mercury and vanadium treated cells. This pathway is also associated with T2DM [65]. Both arsenic and nickel may affect fat digestion and absorption.\nArsenic exposed cells form a relatively distant cluster from the other heavy metal treated cells (Fig. 1A). This might indicate that a different set of pathways are affected by arsenic. Pathways that are affected by arsenic alone are steroid biosynthesis, pentose phosphate pathway and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation. A previous study showed that chronic exposure to arsenic can significantly decrease the serum level of progesterone in female mice [66]. Arsenic can become a serious threat to reproductive health of women by acting as an endocrine disruptor and restricting the structure and function of uterus through alterations in gonadotropins and steroid levels at both low and high concentrations [67]. Similarly, arsenic can affect male development and reproduction by altering spermatogenesis, lowering testosterone and gonadotropins and disrupting steroidogenesis [68]. On top of that, arsenic exposure can significantly alter stem cell differentiation pathways including Wnt and Notch signaling, resulting in increased developmental abnormalities, and higher mortality rate of the embryo [69]. Pentose phosphate pathway is a glucose metabolizing pathway, which gives cells the capability to deal with oxidative stress, and thus, may play a role in oxidative stress-induced diabetes [70].\nHg, Ni, Fe, and V affected pathways have many considerable overlaps and include purine metabolism, HIF-1A signaling pathway, fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis, protein digestion and absorption, glycerolipid metabolism, phosphatidylinositol signaling and ferroptosis pathways (Fig. 1B)). The distant position of the only dataset with Fe treatment (#20 in Fig. 1A) from the Ni, Hg and V treated datasets may indicate that this essential nutrient shares fewer common pathways with the other three. Iron plays role in a number of important functions in body such as activation, transport, and storage of molecular oxygen, reduction of ribonucleotides as well as peroxides [71]. But overload with this essential micronutrient for a prolonged period can be toxic to biological systems as it can lead to free radical generation and may mediate damages to heart, liver and exocrine organs including the pancreas [72]. Ferroptosis, a recently described cell death process associated with iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation, which directly or indirectly affect glutathione peroxidase resulting in a decrease in antioxidant capacity and accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells [73], is over-represented in Fe, Hg and V treated cell group. This calls for further investigation to assess whether a similar cellular death process can be induced by other metals like Hg and V.\nOne distinguishable pathway between Ni and the other (Fe, Hg and V) heavy metal treated cells is the pentose and glucuronate interconversion pathway, which appears to be under-represented in Ni treated cells. This particular pathway is under-represented in the Cr-treated cells as well. Except this one pathway, Cr appears to have the least impact on cellular metabolism. Effects of Fe, Hg, and V on purine metabolism and HIF-1A signaling pathways are more pronounced than those of Ni. In fact, Vanadate- a vanadium oxoanion, is known to induce expression of HIF-1α in a hypoxia-like manner, which in turn leads to progression and metastasis of cancer by increasing expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [74]. Nickel is also known to cause sustained activation of HIF-1α in different human cells [75,76].\nAs shown in Fig. 1A, there is a tendency of the cell lines treated with a particular heavy metal to cluster closely unless the exposed heavy metal concentration is much different. Also, datasets derived from a particular cell line treated with low concentration of different heavy metals for relatively short period of time tends to appear nearby in the plot (For example, #5 and #15 in Fig. 1A). The two datasets derived from arsenic treated hepatic stem cell line (HepaRG) derived cells cluster together (#8 and #9 in Fig. 1A), but at a distance from the other cell lines. Although HepaRG and HepG2 are human hepatic cell lines, these have different gene expression profiles and consequently show different responses or sensitivity to various toxicants [[77], [78], [79]]. In addition, the tissue origin of HepaRG cell line might have some influence in the effect of heavy metals on metabolism. HepaRG clusters closer to HepG2 than MCF-7 and BEAS-2B (Fig. 1A). Both HepaRG and HepG2 cell lines are used as models to understand hepatotoxicity and xenobiotic metabolism [80,81]. Hence, such clustering pattern might be considered as inherent controls in the study, which is indicative of non-random clustering of the other cell line derived-datasets used.\nThe distinct cluster of the arsenic treated cells (except #8 and #9 in Fig. 1A) suggests that this metalloid affects similar pathways under different circumstances (chronic vs. acute, and low vs. high load). This appears to be the same for the Cd and Cr treated cells. In addition to the high concentration of iron used, the difference in the origins of the cells might be responsible for the distant placement of Fe treated cells from the rest (Hg and V) in the same group. Differences in the concentration of Ni along with the origin of the cells might be accountable for the relatively loose clustering of Ni-treated cells as well (Fig. 1A).\n3.2. Dependence of the affected pathways on cell lines, dose and duration of treatment # Datasets used in this study were derived from different cells of human origin. Two of these are human cancer cell lines- HepG2 (from liver cancer cells) [82] and MCF7 (from human breast cancer cells) [83]. HepaRG is a bi-potent hepatic stem cell line [84,85]. BEAS-2B is a human bronchial epithelium derived immortalized, but non-tumorigenic epithelial cell line [86]. NPrEC is a normal prostate epithelial cell line [87] whereas UROtsa is an immortalized normal urothelium cell line [88].\nAlthough different cell lines treated with same heavy metal/metalloid tend to cluster close to one another (Fig. 1A), within-group differences in the positioning of individual datasets is also apparent based on the tissue origin of the studied cell lines (Fig. 2), concentrations of the metals used and duration of exposure (Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5). To assess whether the effects of heavy metals is dependent on the tissue of origin, we grouped the datasets based on the cell lines (Fig. 2). Each group, therefore, contained datasets derived from the same cell type despite treatments with different heavy metals/metalloid. Since there were 3 or more datasets for only HepG2 and BEAS-2B cell lines, the rest of the datasets were grouped together. As shown in Fig. 2, datasets of the same cell lines clustered together. Within the “Other” group, the HepaRG datasets grouped distantly from the rest (#8 and #9 in Fig. 2) regardless of the nature of the heavy metal exposure. A study demonstrated that arsenic (in sodium arsenite form) inhibits the differentiation of progenitor like HepaRG into mature hepatocytes and upregulates genes involved in cell growth, proliferation, and survival [89]. In contrast, arsenic down-regulates cell proliferation genes and increase cell death in terminally differentiated hepatocyte-like HepaRG cells [89]. Fig. 1, Fig. 2 reiterate that there may be differences in the affected pathways in different cells of the same tissue origin in response to heavy metal exposure. Likewise, the MCF7 cell derived datasets (#5 and #15 in Fig. 2) clustered closely (Figs. 1A and 2) suggesting the involvement of similar pathways following both arsenic and cadmium treatment. Previous studies also reported that both cadmium and arsenic affect similar processes in MCF7 cell line [[90], [91], [92], [93]]. Similarly, BEAS-2B cell (non-tumorigenic epithelial cell line) derived datasets formed close cluster despite treatment with different heavy metals and metalloid (As, Cr, Ni and V) at varied concentrations (Fig. 2). There appears to be less within-group variation in BEAS-2B group. All these heavy metals and metalloid are directly or indirectly associated with the development of lung cancer [[94], [95], [96], [97]].\nFig. 2 Download : Download high-res image (705KB)Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2.

Arsenic and cadmium influenced pathways in HepG2 cell lines # Impacts of arsenic on the cellular pathways in HepG2 cell line compared to the other cell lines are shown in Fig. 3. The close clustering of 0.5–6 μM arsenic treated HepG2 cells (#2, #3 and #4 in the Fig. 3A) and their relative distant positions from the 20 μM arsenic treated cells (#1 in Fig. 3) suggest differential impact at high concentration of this metalloid. It can be inferred that this variation in affected pathways might be due to the difference in concentration and duration of exposure. Previous studies also suggested that there may be differences in arsenic-mediated symptoms and complications depending on the duration (acute vs. chronic) and the exposure levels [4,98].\nArsenic has drastically different effects on HepG2 cell line compared to other cell lines (Fig. 3). All the over-represented pathways with VIP score \u0026gt; 1.5 were associated with HepG2 cell line (Fig. 3B). Among the affected pathways Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) mediated phagocytosis and steroid biosynthesis pathways, in particular, distinguish the HepG2 cell line from the other cell lines in the PLS-DA plot (Fig. 3A). Liver is the main organ for the uptake of FcγR mediated antibody-containing immune complexes (ICs) from circulation [99]. Liver is also the major metabolic organ in the body and has crucial role in steroid hormone homeostasis, which is critical in the regulation of various biological pathways, including the reproductive system and responses during stress [100]. Malfunction of these processes may lead to severe liver diseases as well as several endocrine syndromes [100]. Arsenic-induced alterations of steroid metabolism have been reported in mice fetus [101]. Additionally, a previous study reported that chronic low-level arsenic exposure can suppress the expression of Fcγ receptor [102].\nThe PLS-DA plot along with the overrepresented pathways in cadmium treated cell lines are shown in Fig. 4. Alike arsenic, the concentration of cadmium appears to have an influence on metabolism which is evident from distribution of the HepG2 cells exposed to different concentrations of cadmium. The distant clustering of the other three cadmium-treated cell lines (UROtsa, NPrEC and MCF7) might indicate the influence of tissue origin on the impact of heavy metals.\nCompared to arsenic, cadmium has less pronounced effect on metabolic pathways in HepG2 than the other cell lines (Fig. 4). Among the pathways with substantial contribution to observed clustering pattern, only mineral absorption in HepG2 is strongly affected by cadmium (Fig. 4B). Cadmium is in fact known to interfere with calcium metabolism [18].\nCadmium is known to affect tight junctions, influenza A and Rap1 signaling pathways in the other cell lines. Influenza A virus up-regulates the expression of IL-27 in human lung epithelial cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells through Cyclooxygenase-2 and Protein Kinase A (PKA) signaling [103]. Rap1 participates in the calcium mediated induction of PKA-CREB [103]. Viruses that cause respiratory illnesses, like the influenza A viruses and coronaviruses (specifically, SARS coronavirus), use proteins that target members of the MAGUK family of proteins and disrupt the tight junctions [104]. So, these pathways affected by Cd in the other cell lines might be interconnected.\n3.4. Effects of different heavy metals on the metabolic pathways in HepG2 cell line # Fig. 5 shows the variation among the pathways in As, Cd, Cr, Hg and Ni mediated toxicities in HepG2 cell line alone. The choice of HepG2 was not arbitrary. HepG2 is the most widely used cell line in metabolic studies and represent the largest number of datasets used in this study. This liver carcinoma cell line is often found to replicate the in vivo environment well despite its tumorigenic origin [105]. The pathways affected by arsenic in HepG2 datasets (Fig. 5B) considerably overlap with the pathways affected by arsenic in different cell lines irrespective of tissue origin (Fig. 1A). When the effects of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, mercury and nickel on HepG2 cell line are assessed, more pathways appear to be affected by arsenic (Fig. 5), which matches to the effects observed with the other cell lines as well (Fig. 1). In addition, arsenic appears to affect several other pathways in HepG2 cells including biosynthesis of terpenoids and unsaturated fatty acids, which might be indicative of its tissue of origin. Studies with animal models have shown that arsenic-induced liver injury is accompanied with changes in liver fatty acid profiles [106,107]. Additionally, HepG2 is a model system to study fatty acid synthesis in human liver [108]. Hence, it can be assumed that arsenic can alter fatty acid metabolism in hepatic tissues of human origin.\n4. Conclusion # This study explored the effects of several commonly encountered heavy metals and metalloid on the metabolic pathways of different cell lines of human origin. The affected metabolic pathways are modulated by not only the heavy metal per se, but also the nature and origin of the cells. Therefore, the tissue origin must be considered while assessing the effects of a particular heavy metal/metalloid. Among the heavy metals and metalloid, arsenic appears to have more pleiotropic effects on cellular pathways, including a few known to have association with diabetes. One important limitation of this study is the inability to predict whether the affected pathways were induced or inhibited by the heavy metals. Despite this limitation, this study provides useful information about the pathways that are affected by particular heavy metals and may be directive in further exploration using wet-lab based techniques.\nStatement of ethics # This study neither involved any human nor animal, and hence no ethical approval was required.\nFunding sources # Grant for Advanced Research in Education (GARE) from the Ministry of Education, Bangladesh.\nAuthor contributions # Design of the work- AAS; Acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of data- KF, SSS, TA, ZH, AFS; Manuscript preparation and reviewing- SSS, KF, TA, AAS\nDeclaration of Competing Interest # The authors declare no conflict of interest.\nAcknowledgement # This study was supported by a Grant on Advanced Research in Education (GARE) from the Ministry of Education, Bangladesh.

They wanted to define values and basic principles for better software development. On top of being brought into focus, the manifesto has been widely adopted by developers, in software-developing organizations and outside the world of IT. Agile principles and their implementation in practice have paved the way for radical new and innovative ways of software and product development. In parallel, the understanding of the manifesto’s underlying principles evolved over time. This, in turn, may affect current and future applications of agile principles. This article presents results from a survey and an interview study in collaboration with the original contributors of the manifesto for agile software development. Furthermore, it comprises the results from a workshop with one of the original authors. This publication focuses on the origins of the manifesto, the contributors’ views from today’s perspective, and their outlook on future directions. We evaluated 11 responses from the survey and 14 interviews to understand the viewpoint of the contributors. They emphasize that agile methods need to be carefully selected and agile should not be seen as a silver bullet. They underline the importance of considering the variety of different practices and methods that had an influence on the manifesto. Furthermore, they mention that people should question their current understanding of “agile” and recommend reconsidering the core ideas of the manifesto.\nIntroduction # Nowadays, companies are confronted with high-frequent changes due to innovations and new technology (Broy 2006). Innovations such as cloud based services, big data and digitalization are spreading into all markets and all kinds of products. A lot of innovation is achieved in the combination of software and new types of devices. This combination offers new opportunities in a fast pace, which asks one by one a response from the market. Consequently, the amount of software and connected solutions, e.g. in cars (Broy 2006), increased exponentially during the last decades. Therefore, it is a competitive advantage to develop and distribute high-quality software and connected solutions at a high pace.\nAgile software development methods are a promising solution to keep pace with this progress. The rise of agile methods and practices started to get significant attention 17 years ago with the manifesto for agile software development, often referred to as “agile manifesto” although not meant to be agile itself (Thomas 2017).\nA lot of publications (Highsmith 2002; Dingsøyr et al. 2012; Abrahamsson et al. 2002) which were published during the last 17 years interpret the statements from the manifesto and introduce agile practices, principles, and methods. The manifesto is usually referred to whenever developers aim at conducting agile development (Beck et al. 2001):\nWe are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation\nResponding to change over following a plan\nThat is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.\nThe manifesto was written by 17 software practitioners in 2001 in Snowbird, near Salt Lake County, Utah. On being asked about the motivation for setting up the manifesto, Kent Beck mentions that they wanted to “uncover better ways of developing software” (Beck et al. 2001). Ron Jeffries adds that the original idea “Kent Beck had in mind with Extreme Programming, [was] to make the world safe for programmers” (Lockard et al. 2017). A “safe” development environment is not only the motivation of Extreme Programming (XP). It is common for most agile methods, to improve the working conditions of developers. This can be seen as a main factor for the success of the manifesto for agile software development.\nThe rise of agile methods was welcomed with enthusiasm by many developers but also led to criticism. At least two mindsets of approaching agile development with potentially different outcomes could be observed: There are those developers who apply agile practices because they believe in the values and principles of the manifesto, and those who do it because it is seen as best practice. The manifesto for agile software development seemed to promise a more successful way of developing software by “just” following the original values and principles. This, in turn, makes the manifesto special. Some developers believed and still believe in the manifesto as the “Holy Grail” for successful software development, while others denote it as a marketing gimmick to sell intuitive development behavior within a new livery.\nNevertheless, the ongoing success of agile had several implications. Among others, new trends like scaling agile with Scrum of Scrums (SoS) or the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) are common talk. The original ideas of the manifesto have become more and more commercialized. Many developers and managers that are now adopting agile are not aware of the initial diversity of agile methods and the underlying principles. Scrum is often seen as the only agile practice (Klünder et al. 2017).\nThe so-called agile transformation of organizations is a frequently discussed topic because agile ways of working promise to make companies future-proof (Lockard and Cleff 2016). However, the developers often declare themselves “agile” when just using Scrum by the book. In this case, the meaning of agile is wrongly interpreted, not understood, and commercialized (Klünder et al. 2017). This is one of the reasons why we conducted this survey and the interview study: In our daily work, we have often seen the trend of doing agile for the sake of doing agile and we wanted to know what the originators think about it.\nA variety of agile methodologies influenced the manifesto, its values and principles. The aim of this article is to recall the past and to reflect on the present agile world. Therefore, we scrutinized the manifesto from various perspectives. We collected first-hand data to draw an undistorted picture. We combine the results of a survey, in which 11 of the 17 original contributors participated, with the outcome of an interview study with 14 of the 17 contributors. Furthermore, we gained insights from a workshop with Arie van Bennekum who is among the authors of the agile manifesto and also a co-author of this article. We explicitly indicate throughout the article when his individual perspective or opinion is presented. As secondary data, we also included insights from previously held talks at conferences of given interviews of the original authors.\nThe main contributions of this work consist in:\nCollect background information to identify the techniques and methods that influenced the manifesto. Identify the evolution of interpretations of the statements in the manifesto and future directions from the original contributors’ point of view. Present selected challenges, prerequisites and success factors for an agile transformation. The remainder of the article is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses related work. Section 3 defines the study approach and the research design, while Section 4 presents and discusses the findings of our research. In Section 5, we discuss the findings and conclude the publication in Section 6.\nBackground and related work # There are interesting contributions from the time before the rise of the manifesto (Larman and Basili 2003) and afterwards (Dingsøyr et al. 2012).\nBefore the manifesto # Larman and Basili (2003) describe the history of Iterative and Incremental Software development (IID), starting in the pre-70s and ending up with the manifesto in 2001. They describe the relationship between IID and agile methods as follows: “In February 2001, a group of 17 process experts [\u0026hellip;] interested in promoting modern, simple IID methods and principles met in Utah to discuss common ground” ((Larman and Basili 2003), p. 54). In the publication by Larman and Basili (2003) they structured the agile history into decades. According to the research of Larman and Basili (2003), the agile mindset started in the 1930s with the idea of “plan-do-study-act” cycles. They mention several projects, such as NASA’s project Mercury (the first human spaceflight program of the United States) or the software development for the US Navy’s helicopter-to-ship weapon system, which all applied IID practices. They point out that practices such as short iterations and test-first development were already used in the Mercury project. These practices remained present in the agile methods such as Scrum or XP (Larman and Basili 2003).\nIn the seventies, Royce (1970) published an article which is considered as the basis for the waterfall-model. In his article Royce describes his personal views of managing large software developments and what is “necessary to transform a risky development process into one that will provide the desired product” ((Royce 1970), p. 335). His approach aims at reaching the condition of working software delivered on-time and within costs (Royce 1970). Royce proposes to use the waterfall model’s phases with an iterative relationship between successive phases. The process benefits by scoping down the development process to manageable limits (Royce 1970). He furthermore suggests using prototypes to get an early simulation of the final product. In addition, he presents first reflections about iterative development, feedback and adaption (Larman and Basili 2003; Royce 1970).\nIn the 1980s, many approaches of incremental software development were presented (Wallis 1984; Swartout and Balzer 1982), such as Boehm’s spiral model (Boehm 1986). The spiral model is a risk-driven approach to software development. According to Boehm, the spiral model resulted from a “risk-management variant of the waterfall model” ((Boehm 1986), p. 23). The development process is divided into several circles which comprise steps like risk analysis, circle planning and reviews. As he points out, “the model holds that each cycle involves a progression through the same sequence of steps” ((Boehm 1986), p. 24). He concludes that the risk-driven approach is more adaptable than document-driven (waterfall) and code-driven (evolutionary development) approaches (Boehm 1986).\nThe work of Boehm and others present approaches at that time which led to the occurrence of Rapid Iterative Production Prototyping (RIPP) in the mid-to-late eighties (Buragga and Zaman 2013). This project management methodology was a property of Du Pont Information Engineering Association, the consulting business unit of Du Pont Co. (Margolis 1988). Scott Shultz, who was a manager at Du Pont at that time, states: “What users tell you they want isn’t always what they really want” ((Margolis 1988), p. 110). Direct customer collaboration led to a definite plus with clear benefits (Margolis 1988).\nJames Martin learned about the RIPP methodology from Scott Shultz at Du Pont (Larman 2004). Based on the success of RIPP, Martin promoted the iterative and time-boxed development himself, which led to the creation of the Rapid Application Development (RAD) (Larman 2004). The RAD approach included a quick and iterative delivery with a small team of highly skilled developers (Abbas et al. 2008). In addition, RAD set the basis for the Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM), which had a wide user audience in north-west Europe such as the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Denmark.\nSeveral decades of software development and best practices from development approaches and applications in industry ended up in the meeting in Utah, where the most suitable techniques were combined within the manifesto for agile software development.\nAfter the manifesto # A variety of publications (Dingsøyr et al. 2012; Theocharis et al. 2015) consider the evolution of agile software development after 2001. Diverse theoretical approaches and numerous points of view on the manifesto, the practices used, the implementation of the principles, or human involvement have led to a wide range of publications within the last 16 years.\nDingsøyr et al. (2012) present a literature review of the evolution in the agile community. They present an overview of 1551 papers on agile development until 2010. This reflects the still increasing interest in adapting agile methods whose applications are considered in many different contexts and combinations.\nTheocharis et al. (2015) conducted a literature study in 2015 resulting in a variety of different development approaches. The identified approaches often come from a combination of traditional approaches and agile methods. They called those combinations hybrid approaches and identify the method Water-Scrum-Fall (Theocharis et al. 2015) as the most widespread one. Water-Scrum-Fall is the combination of Scrum and the waterfall model. This model is seen as one approach to the adaption of agile elements into traditional development approaches.\nKuhrmann et al. (2017) set up the HELENA study, an international study on the use of Hybrid dEveLopmENt Approaches in software systems development1. The HELENA study started in 2017 to figure out how hybrid approaches have spread into the development of software worldwide. The HELENA team consisting of more than 80 researchers from all over the world investigates the distribution of hybrid software and system development in practice. The HELENA study is ongoing research and final results have not been presented yet.\nFootnote\nIn 2002, Abrahamsson et al. (2002) published a literature review aiming at the analysis of agile methods. They analyzed ten methods such as Extreme Programming and Scrum which are characterized as “being agile” with respect to the authors’ definition. Furthermore, they compared the similarities and differences of these methods. In contrast to our approach, Abrahamsson et al. (2002) based their research on publications instead of asking the original contributors whether the agile teams are “agile” according to the original contributors’ understanding.\nPathak and Saha (2013) reviewed different agile methods and compared them with conventional process methods. Furthermore, they analyzed pros and cons of applying these agile processes to research projects. They also pointed out difficulties in adapting agile methods. The contribution focused on existing literature in that field instead of presenting the thoughts of those who started “thinking agile”.\nIn 2002, Highsmith (2002) described the most important principles of agile development from his point of view, such as delivering value to the customer and focusing on individual developers and their skills. He also presented all major agile methods such as Scrum or Extreme Programming. Highsmith (2002) proposed a method of transforming a company into a truly agile organization.\nResearch method # This section presents the data collection consisting of a survey, an interview study, a workshop with one original contributor, and data provided by the survey participants.\nResearch questions # The aim of this study is to preserve the initial thoughts of the original contributors of the manifesto and to elicit their viewpoint of the future of the manifesto and agile development in general. We are interested in answering the following research questions:\nRQ 01: What influences and intentions led to the manifesto for agile software development?\nThis question focuses on the agile practices and methods that had an influence on the manifesto. Furthermore, it will clarify the original contribution to the manifesto.\nRQ 02: What do the original authors think about the manifesto today?\nThis question examines if there are parts of the manifesto the original authors would skip or change today. It helps to clarify whether the interpretations of the manifesto are still valid or represent the original ideas.\nRQ 03: What do the original authors think about the manifesto’s future?\nThis question deals with the necessity of new concepts and adjustments of the manifesto. According to the initial idea of being “agile”, it is necessary to learn and adapt according to the given context. Therefore, it is important to rethink the original ideas and to examine their influence on today’s software development in practice.\nRQ 04: What do the original authors think about the future of agile software development?\nThis question focus on the future directions of agile software development. Furthermore, it presents necessary steps to preserve the origin of agile in the future.\nData collection # The data collection and analysis bases on four different data sources, which are presented in this section. An overview can be found in Table 1. The survey and the interview study were set up at the same time with the same goal to preserve the original agile mindset2. The workshop resulted from the survey and aims at providing deeper insights into the agile movement. In order to gain a consistent picture of the ideas, we combined the studies.\nFootnote\nTable 1 Overview of data sources Full size table\nSurvey # Research design. According to Yin (2009), the type of the research questions defines the usage of different research methods. The defined research questions are mainly “what”-questions which are used in exploratory studies. This class of research question are knowledge questions resulting in a clearer understanding of the phenomena (Easterbrook et al. 2008). According to Forza (2002), surveys can be divided into three different groups: exploratory surveys, descriptive surveys, and explanatory surveys.\nOur study is founded on a qualitative and a descriptive survey design to obtain knowledge about the manifesto. The survey aims at describing and explaining the phenomenon of the manifesto by using a questionnaire for data collection. A characteristic of survey research is the selection of a representative sample from a well-defined population (Easterbrook et al. 2008). The sample selection is explicitly limited to the 17 original authors of the manifesto because we wanted to obtain first-hand information. With this selection, the sample size is sufficient to represent the population of interest.\nTable 1 Overview of data sources\nData Source Initials of executing authors Initials of analyzing authors Number of participants Further information Survey P.H., J.K.

P.H., J.K. 3 Section 3.2.3 Secondary data - P.H., J.K. - Section 3.2.4 The survey questions are classified as open questions according to Dresch et al. (2015). The number of questions is limited to five in order to shorten time to answer the questionnaire. This increases the respondent involvement and thus reduces the amount of missing data (Forza 2002). Furthermore, the participants are asked for permission to use the given answers and information anonymously in this publication.\nAll survey questions are directly mapped to the research questions.\nWhy did you participate in the manifesto for agile software development 16 years ago? (aims at answering RQ1) What was your original contribution to the manifesto for agile software development? (aims at answering RQ1) Which parts of the manifesto would you skip or change today? (aims at answering RQ2) Are there necessary new concepts and adjustments for the manifesto? (aims at answering RQ3) What trends will shape the future of agile development from your perspective? (aims at answering RQ4) Forza (2002) recommends conducting a pilot test of the questionnaire with colleagues, industry experts and target respondents. A pilot test was conducted with another researcher and an industry expert. The feedback they provided led to some modifications of the questionnaire to make the questions more comprehensible for the participants.\nExecution. The survey was conducted in January and February 2017. We sent an invitation letter and the questionnaire to all contributors of the manifesto. In total, we received 11 answers.\nIn order to collect the data, we chose two different ways to get in touch with the original contributors and to send them the questionnaire. First, we searched for email addresses on the private blogs and homepages. We directly contacted Martin Fowler and Ron Jeffries via personal email. Both provided answers to the questionnaire. To get in contact with the other 15 participants, Researcher 1 signed up for a recruiter membership on LinkedIn3. With the recruiter profile, it was possible to get in contact with the original contributors and to send them the questionnaire via LinkedIn. The recruiter membership contract was canceled after one month. Within that month, we received answers from 9 participants.\nFootnote\nIn most of the responses, the items of the questionnaire were directly answered. The length of the provided answers varied from one sentence per question to multiple pages to answer the complete questionnaire.\nWe were invited by one participant to a Skype™ call to discuss the questions face-to-face. The following interview was a one-hour Skype™ conference in which two researchers and one contributor participated. The interview was recorded by both researchers, and the meeting minutes were subsequently combined.\nTwo other participants from the study referred to the ongoing project “Agile Uprising Agile Manifesto Review” conducted by Ryan Lockard and James Gifford (2016) (cf. Section 3.2.2).\nData analysis. The collected qualitative data was analyzed using categorization and data coding. According to the classification of Stol et al. (2016), the coding concepts of Straussian Grounded Theory were used. We used the presented three coding phases: open coding, axial coding, and selective coding (Stol et al. 2016; Corbin and Strauss 1990). The interpretive process of open coding generates categories and concepts by breaking down the data analytically. The written answers were chunked into small, logically related phrases and tagged with a code. Each code represents a certain theme, whereas the codes form a hierarchy of codes and sub-codes in the axial coding. In the selective coding, the central categories were defined. This leads to the final result, a formalized body of knowledge (Runeson and Höst 2009). To analyze, categorize and sort the collected data, we used the tagging and coding functionality in the reference management and citation tool Citavi.\nInterview study # The interview study was mainly conducted by Ryan Lockard and James Gifford as part of the “manifesto authors review” in a podcast (Lockard 2016) for the Agile Uprising network. The network focuses on the advancement of the agile mindset and global professional networking between leading agilists. The network purely focuses on the advancements of the agile craft removing external influences from sponsors, partners and other organizations (Lockard 2016).\nResearch design. Since October 2016, Ryan Lockard and James Gifford have performed an interview study (Lockard 2016), asking the original contributors about the reasons for participating in the meeting that ended up with the manifesto.\nThe study has been designed as an exploratory semi-structured interview. For the interviews, an interview guide has been designed. This guide has been developed in an iterative way. It was pilot-tested and adjusted to the problems which have arisen. The structure of the guide is divided into three parts: (1) before the meeting, (2) at the meeting and (3) afterwards (cf. Appendix A)\nExecution. The interview study took place from October 2016 till March 2017. Getting in touch with the contributors was an iterative process. Ryan Lockard and James Gifford first contacted three of them, namely John Kern, Alistair Cockburn and Bob Martin. In the interview, they asked them to share the idea of the podcast with other contributors. This way, another batch of three contributors to continue was created. In total, 14 contributors were interviewed. Two of them have been interviewed in person (John Kern and Alistair Cockburn), the others have been interviewed via Skype™. Skype™ sessions and face-to-face interviews were recorded and afterwards published in the uprising podcast channel.\nThe average duration for an interview is 50 min, whereas the shortest interview, a mashup of interviews published by Scrum.org, is 17 min and the longest 1 h and 18 min.

The data analysis was conducted by Researcher 1 and Researcher 2 by coding the meeting minutes. The coding process followed the coding concept presented in Section 3.2.1. The results have been analyzed according to the research questions.\nWorkshop # After having answered the questionnaire, Arie van Bennekum invited Researcher 1 and Researcher 2 for a 1-day workshop to discuss the origins and future directions of the manifesto. He furthermore suggested, to discuss the future of the agile movement in general. He organized a workshop to discuss these topics in detail.\nThe workshop took place in Oktober 2017 in Rotterdam, Netherlands. The workshop was separated in two sessions of 2, 5 h each. In the first session, Researcher 1 and Researcher 2 presented the results from the survey and discussed the findings with Arie van Bennekum. In the second session, Arie van Bennekum presented his view on the future of the agile movement and the importance of agile transformation. Researcher 1 and Researcher 2 wrote meeting minutes and merged them after the workshop.\nThe data analysis was done by Researcher 1 and Researcher 2, according to the previously identified codes from the data analysis of the survey.\nSecondary data # Some participants of the survey referred to previously held presentations at conferences, and interviews about the manifesto in previous publications. We used this information as a secondary data source. Therefore, we also transcribed the talk “Agile is Dead” from the conference “GOTO Amsterdam” given by Dave Thomas (2017) in 2015. Furthermore, we included an interview with Kent Beck (2011) from 2011. To analyze, categorize and sort the collected data, we used the tagging and coding functionality in the reference management and citation tool Citavi. The secondary data sets are limited to the recommendations given by the survey participants.\nThreats to validity # In accordance with Wohlin et al. (2012), we consider four commonly used criteria for validity.\nConstruct validity. The construction of the questionnaire aims at preventing a wrong interpretation of the questions. To minimize the risk of misunderstandings, a pilot test was conducted and a short explanation was given to the participants. The semi-structured Skype™ interview was based on the questionnaire.\nAll conducted interviews were guided by pre-defined open questions (cf. Appendix A). They all started with a description of the interviewee’s background and the reason for attending the meeting in Snowbird in 2001. The focus of the interview is set on the meeting itself. Furthermore, it gives an outlook on agile development in future.\nFor data triangulation, we extended our study with data sources, which were provided by participants of the survey. This data includes a presentation at a conference (Thomas 2017) and an interview (Denning 2011).\nRecall bias may have led to misinterpretations of statements of both data sources. We reduced this threat by interpreting and discussing the results with at least two researchers.\nInternal validity. The internal validity is significant when causal relations are examined (Wohlin et al. 2012). This was not relevant for our mainly descriptive survey (Wohlin et al. 2012). However, we have to mention that we promised the participants to anonymize the answers from our survey. These statements are therefore marked as “Anonymous” in this publication.\nExternal validity. The results of the survey may not be generalized. However, the findings could be interesting for other people in order to learn about the manifesto. Nowadays, the agile mindset is spreading into all businesses and industries. It could be a benefit to know the basics and the origin of the agile mindset. Of course, the results of our survey are subjective impressions of 11 of the 17 authors.\nThe result of the interview study do not necessarily represent the opinion of all original authors. But we do not claim to generalize the results. We only present a subjective overview of the meeting in Snowbird and future directions of the manifesto.\nConclusion validity. We try to retain the original agile knowledge for people who want to learn more about the original contributor’s view on the manifesto for agile software development. We do not draw conclusions from the acquired data.\nReliability. The main goal of reliability is to minimize errors and biases in the survey. We took several steps to improve reliability. The questionnaire was pilot-tested by a colleague and an industry expert. The questions were explained and additional information was given.\nReliability may be affected by answers that are not provided. The overall picture of the manifesto may be incomplete due to the missing opinions from six originalauthors.\nAnother influence is the phenomenon of “recall bias”. In the dictionary of epidemiology, recall bias is defined as “systematic error due to differences in accuracy or completeness of recall to memory of past events or experiences” ((Porta et al. 2014), p. 240). Both the meeting and the creation of the manifesto were conducted 17 years ago. Some interviewees mentioned that they could not remember every single detail from the meeting.\nYet another factor that may influence reliability are the researchers themselves, by misinterpretation and errors in transcriptions. We tried to avoid the “halo effect” (Porta et al. 2014), which would influence the interpretation of the findings by the previously gained knowledge. The fact that two researchers were conducting the survey leads to reciprocal control.\nResults: past, present and future of the agile manifesto # Research question 1: influences and intentions # What influences and intentions led to the manifesto for agile software development?\nIn 1999, Kent Beck invited to a special conference he called the XP leadership conference. Bob (Robert) Martin, Martin Fowler, Ron Jeffries, Ward Cunningham, Kent Beck and several others attended this conference (Lockard and Gifford 2016). At the conference, they talked about lightweight processes, realizing that they needed to set up another meeting in order to focus on a broader approach for better software development (Lockard et al. 2017).\nIn 2001, they set up a meeting to find more effective development methods. They wanted to search for common ground (Lockard and Cleff 2016; Lockard and Gifford 2016b). Some of the participants had developed their own working methods and lightweight processes. Highsmith (2017c) did consulting and trainings in structured methodologies and realized that his way of working varied from what he taught. Hunt (2016b) realized that all his clients were working exactly the same (wrong) way and had the same problems in their projects, such as dissatisfied customers or broken deadlines. At that time, Thomas and Hunt published their book “The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master” (Hunt and Thomas 2000).\nWhen the original contributors of the manifesto met in 2001, they tried to identify areas the used methodologies had in common (Lockard and Gifford 2017b). At the beginning of the meeting in 2001, everyone gave a short presentation of his development practice. The echoes of the participants in the manifesto and the principles are still perceptible. Jeffries (2017) describes it as a general feeling that they had similar methodologies, and gave them a higher-level guideline to follow. Highsmith (2017c) mentions that the success of the manifesto is based on the fact that they focused on the similarities of the methodologies for software development. In his opinion, this is the reason why agile is still valid. It is not based on processes but on values and principles.\nThe results of our study are shown in Fig 1. It visualizes the practices and methods that had an influence on the manifesto for agile software development. Arie van Bennekum pointed out, “they all share two common treats: the aim to diminish bureaucracy and a focus on valuable deliverables” (Lockard and Cleff 2016). The following section discribes the methods which had an influence on the agile manifesto. The statements of the originators shall help to sharpen the reader’s understanding that there are more methods than SCRUM and XP.\nFig. 1 figure1 Practices and methods that had an influence on the manifesto for agile software development\nFull size image\nDynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) # DSDM, first published in February 1995, is an agile framework developed and supported by the DSDM Consortium for dynamic, non-predictable projects. It focuses on early delivery in an iterative development process with close customer collaboration. Nowadays, it also includes project management (the Agile PM Framework). It consists of seven phases, for instance preparation of a project and deployment to the customer. One practice of DSDM is “time-boxing”. The project is sliced into time-boxes which could themselves be sliced into smaller time-boxes. Requirements are prioritized per time-box (DSDM Consortium 2018). DSDM has its origin in the RUGs, the “Rapid Application Development user groups”. Therefore, the Intellectual Property of DSDM is a community owned Intellectual Property.\nArie van Bennekum mentions that at the time they were “writing the manifesto, the other guys receive DSDM as quite heavy, [and] it did not get that much attention in the US” (Lockard and Cleff 2016). This is also apparent in Mike Beedle’s statement that he “didn’t know DSDM” (Lockard and Gifford 2016a) at that time. Also Jeff Sutherland mentions that he “did not know anything about DSDM, [and] [\u0026hellip;] just met Arie the first time at the meeting” (Lockard and Gifford 2017a). Alistair Cockburn remembers that “Arie van Bennekum had to describe DSDM” at the beginning of the meeting.\nTest Driven Development (TDD) # TDD helps to control the software development process by using tests. The procedure is cyclic and starts by writing a test, which consequently fails in the first attempt due to missing code. In the next step, the developer implements as much code as necessary in order to fulfill the test criteria. Afterwards, code and tests get refactored. Kent Beck presented this incremental method in detail in 2003 (Beck 2003). TDD was part of the XP practice of test-first, which was already presented in 1999 (Copeland 2001).\nJames Grenning states that people “are somehow religious about” (Lockard and Gifford 2017b) TDD. As he points out, it “is more like being an engineer. It’s a problem solving technique one should use when it is appropriate” (Lockard and Gifford 2017b). Ron Jeffries mentions that for refactoring it is necessary to implement the TDD principles and to be able to ship it within one increment (Lockard et al. 2017). Bob Martin refers to his first pair programming and Test Driven Development session with Kent Beck. He admits that he has “never seen something like this before, [\u0026hellip;] [and he has] never seen anybody writing code in this crazy, nutty, high-speed style” (Lockard and Gifford 2016).\nAdaptive Software Development (ASD) # In 2000, Jim Highsmith published his book “Adaptive Software Development” (Highsmith 2000). He mentions that he was writing the “book and there was a chapter in there, about complexity theorem and systems” (Lockard and Gifford 2017c). He remembers that he “started looking into that, as a way of really [\u0026hellip;] become more adaptive. That’s where adaptive software development came from.” (Lockard and Gifford 2017c). ASD provides a collaborative approach to manage complex systems by an adaptive culture in which change and uncertainty are assumed to be the natural state. ASD builds a frame containing only a few guidelines. It consists of speculating, collaborating and learning. Speculating includes the planning process and collaborating aims towards implementation. Teamwork is one key characteristic of the collaborating phase. Learning cycles ensure quality and help in integrating so-called “learning loops”.\nDesign Driven Development (D3), Refactoring # D3 aims at creating innovative requirements to build better solutions. It is based on the following assumptions: Design fulfillment is very important for success. Design is an event randomly occurring during the conception process. This is the key to innovation. The best design is always the result of continuous facilitation and refinement. In 1999, Martin Fowler published his book “Refactoring” (Fowler 1999) to improve the design of any existing code. He states that badly designed software can be reworked into a good one by refactoring the code continuously. He provides principles of refactoring which go hand in hand by setting up required tests to validate the refactored code (Lockard 2017).\nMartin Fowler concludes that “there are still the very basics of refactoring which are not understood by people” (Lockard 2017). He is disappointed with that fact because, for him, it “was the most mind-blowing thing” (Lockard 2017).\nScrum # Scrum itself is not a software development technique, but a framework for managing various kinds of projects. Scrum provides the separation of the whole project into sprints (Schwaber 2004). A sprint is a defined period of time in which to implement a given set of requirements and make them ready for potential delivery. It consists of several core activities, artifacts and roles which need to be extended by suitable practices. The core activities describe meetings during the sprints, like a daily Scrum or a retrospective (Schwaber 2004). The widely used artifacts comprising a product backlog consist of all requirements which have not been implemented of the project, the sprint backlog which defines all tasks for the ongoing sprint, and a product increment which is the sum of all already finished product-backlog-elements (Schwaber 2004). There are mainly three roles involved: the Product Owner defining the requirements, the development team fulfilling the Product Owner’s requests and the Scrum Master helping to create a good atmosphere for the team and to preserve agility (Schwaber 2004).\nRon Jeffries mentions that “Jeff Sutherland had used Scrum since the middle 80s” (Lockard et al. 2017). Jeff Sutherland mentions that he “hired Ken [Schwaber] for a huge banking project” (Lockard and Gifford 2017a) and “wrote a paper 1995 [with him] to kick it off” (Lockard and Gifford 2017a). He emphasizes that he was “driving Scrum before, starting from 1993” (Lockard and Gifford 2017a). His intention was to “teach the style of Scrum to help the people to improve and accelerate” (Lockard and Gifford 2017a). Mike Beedle was the first adopter of the Scrum method. He mentions that using Scrum “was like a miracle drug”(Lockard and Gifford 2016a). He remembers that they had a “project which was nearly three years late but [\u0026hellip;] saved the project with Scrum” (Lockard and Gifford 2016a). Arie van Bennekum points out that nowadays people do often not “know that there were more agile methods than Scrum” (Lockard and Cleff 2016).\nCrystal # Crystal, developed by Alistair Cockburn, is a family of software development methods in agile development. Each “member of this family” usually has a color, with the basic variant being called “Crystal Clear”. Crystal is based on a couple of principles like passive knowledge transfer, continuous delivery, frequent releases and automated testing. Crystal is configured for one project and needs to be adapted for another one. Cockburn (2005)\nAlistair Cockburn came up with crystal in the 90s. He mentions that he realized that “different projects need different things and [\u0026hellip;] [it is necessary to] characterize a situation which calls for a certain type of a behavior” (Lockard 2016b). To distinguish the situations, he “used crystal as a way to separate them out” (Lockard 2016b) and assigned different colors to them. However, Jeff Sutherland mentions that he “never had any exposure to Crystal” (Lockard and Gifford 2017a). In contrast, Mike Beedle states that he had “heard about crystal from Alistair” (Lockard and Gifford 2016a). He further admits that there were only “few instances of crystal” (Lockard and Gifford 2016a). In addition, Ron Jeffries maintains that “Crystal never seemed as a method that is competing in any way” (Lockard et al. 2017).\nExtreme Programming (XP) # In 2000, Kent Beck published his first edition of his book “Extreme Programming explained” (Beck 2000), which marked the starting point for the success of XP. In XP, several practices are described. The most famous and widespread one is pair programming, besides small releases and continuous integration.\nRon Jeffries remembers that Kent Beck invited him “to help coaching, which turned out to be the first Extreme Programming installation” (Lockard et al. 2017). He mentions that it was the effort of Kent Beck who put together the development process, defined “what should be done, and named it Extreme Programming”(Lockard et al. 2017). He further argues that one reason why XP became well-known is based on the fact that Kent Beck did not brand mark it (Lockard et al. 2017).\nBob Martin got in touch with XP, when he “stumbled across Kent Beck’s writings on Extreme Programming” (Lockard and Gifford 2016). He recognizes that “this is great, except for that ridiculous testing thing, the whole notion of test first, that’s nonsense, but the rest of it, the rest of it sounds pretty good” (Lockard and Gifford 2016). Bob Martin recalls that they “made a mistake in the early days of XP, when we put that high emphasize on pair programming”(Lockard and Gifford 2016). He emphasizes that “in realistic agile teams it happen less 50% of all time” (Lockard and Gifford 2016).\nPragmatic programming # In their book “The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master” (Hunt and Thomas 2000), Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt defined software development as a craft. They give special insights into the topic, and tips based on their experience. First, they advise the programmer to care about the craft. A lot of tips represent what later reappears in the agile methodologies. Two examples are tip 16 ”Use prototype to learn” and tip 62 ”Test early, test often, test automatically” (Hunt and Thomas 2000). Finally, they outline a pragmatic way for the efficient, profitable development of high-quality products based on easily understandable tips.\nAndy Hunt and Dave Thomas were looking at pragmatic programming which “is considered not really as a methodology but just more common sense” [Anonymous]. The word “methodology was a bit of a dirty word at the time and we were understandably cautious” [Anonymous]. They both “felt the role as the Pragmatic Programmers was to help defend the interests of the ordinary developer” [Anonymous].\nModeling languages # Steve (Stephen) Mellor created a modeling language that was the forerunner to UML (Shlaer and Mellor 1988). To model components, sequence diagrams, collaboration diagrams, state-transition diagrams, and a combination of state charts and activity diagrams are used. The modeling language then seamlessly translated the component models into code. Code components are compiled into an executable component that is deployed (Mellor and Balcer 2002).\nJames Grenning remembers that “Steve was model driven, so he really wanted to build a model and then we can convert them out into code” (Lockard and Gifford 2017b). He further points out that “the abstraction that Steve brought in was executing. It doesn’t matter if it is code or model or whatever” (Lockard and Gifford 2017b).\nSteve Mellor emphasizes that it is essential “to think about a model is some high-level abstract view of something that takes away certain details, such as processors, data structures, that kind of stuff” (Lockard and Gifford 2017). He identifies the “underlying reason why peoples say [that models are bad] [\u0026hellip;], because they think that models are just sketches and then you write code. And that was not the view that I took, not at all. The model was in fact the code, it just had an abstractive way, sort of relevance need to be filled out separately, not added, but filled out worked on separately” (Lockard and Gifford 2017).\nFeature Driven Development (FDD) # FDD was first described by Jeff De Luca. The FDD process was influenced by Peter Coad and Jon Kern through their collaboration in writing the book “Java modeling in color with UML” (Coad et al. 1999). The process of FDD is model driven, and in the development, this is done in short iterations. The process is built on a core set of best practices. The main idea is to decompose complex functions until each sub-problem is small enough to be called a feature.\nSpeaking about his role in the meeting, John Kern mentions that he “was nobody, but Peter Coad was, [and the reason why he participated] is because [\u0026hellip;][he] was working with Peter Coad, publishing books on Feature Driven Development” (Lockard 2016a).\nResearch question 2: Today’s views on the manifesto # What do the original authors think about the manifesto today?\nThe manifesto was a “big deal” # Alistair Cockburn (2016b) compares the meeting in Snowbird and the creation of the manifesto to the NATO Conference of software engineering in 1968. However, most of the authors in 2001 thought that their manifesto would not be as successful as it has since become. Jim Highsmith (2017c) admits that the success of the manifesto for agile software development took off faster than all authors of the manifesto anticipated. Mike Beedle (2016a) adds that he never foresaw the adaption of agile development practices in other contexts such as leadership or sales. As he recognizes in retrospect, the implications of the manifesto were getting out of control. It took James Grenning (2017b) a couple of years to realize that it was such a “big deal”. He mentions that none of the original authors actually thought that somebody would care about the manifesto. Steve Mellor emphasizes that in retrospect “it makes sense, [but] at that time, I was surprised” (Lockard and Gifford 2017). In hindsight, he mentions “that the manifesto galvanizes [\u0026hellip;][those], who wanted to [\u0026hellip;] code and not to document [and] who wanted [\u0026hellip;] to talk to users separately from the structures of the organization. And as a result, this become a thing” (Lockard and Gifford 2017).\nThe need for changing the wording of the manifesto # The manifesto’s wording is universal. This is one reason that led to the tremendous success of the manifesto and makes it still applicable and successful today [Anonymous]. One participant mentions that “in total, everybody is still pretty happy with the manifesto” [Anonymous]. As the participant points out, the concepts behind the manifesto remain solid. Bob Martin concludes that “the original values and the original ideas have survived” (Lockard and Gifford 2016). Nevertheless, Andy Hunt (2016b) emphasizes that it is crucial to follow the statements as written in the manifesto in order to generate successful software development. Bob Martin points out that the manifesto is not a “living document” (Lockard and Gifford 2016). He also emphasizes that he would not change anything in the original wording of the manifesto. He admits that there may be new concepts and adjustments for industry, but the manifesto is understood as a document in time and not an ongoing recipe. In retrospect, Ron Jeffries would add one more sentence to the manifesto. At the end he would write: “And we really mean it, particular working software” (Lockard and Gifford 2017a). Furthermore, Arie van Bennekum would like to change the wording of the manifesto by replacing the word “software with solutions” (Lockard and Cleff 2016).\nThe difference between “doing agile” and “being agile” # Bob Martin mentions that many organizations think they are “doing agile” when they are not (Lockard and Gifford 2016). Arie van Bennekum points out that there is a huge difference between “doing agile” and “being agile”. He defines “doing” as “just some rituals but without significant change to support the real agile approach as end-to-end, business integration, value focus, and team empowerment” (Hohl 2017). In contrast, he defines that “being agile means [that] the individual, team, [and] organization have changed” (Hohl 2017). This is “when they overcome the old paradigms” (Hohl 2017). These old paradigms hinder an agile approach and the agile transformation. Impediments are “often hidden in management layers and bureaucracy” (Hohl 2017).\nCommon misinterpretations of the agile manifesto # Bob Martin (2016) discovers the problem that the adoption and the understanding of the agile manifesto is different. Bob Martin (2016) points out that the misinterpretation and false implementation of agile is caused by politics, imagination, and economic interest. Martin Fowler (2017) identifies missing support from the business side due to missing knowledge. He mentions that this leads to the unpleasant effect that the agile ideas are often misinterpreted. Furthermore, misinterpretation leads to pressure on the programmers instead of creating a motivating and productive working environment. Forcing programmers to change is not possible and will end up in developers resignation [Anonymous]. Bob Martin (2016) remembers that they also made a mistake in the early days of XP when they put high emphasis on pair programming by pushing it too hard. He emphasizes that the time for developing software in pairs should be kept at a reasonable amount of time (Lockard and Gifford 2016). In realistically minded agile teams, it is always a trade-off between specific needs and context. Another participant mentioned that a a context-specific selection of practices is necessary [Anonymous]. Andy Hunt adds that “the rationale behind many of the practices is how to get quick and reliable feedback on what you are doing” (Lockard and Gifford 2016b). Even though there is a lot of misinterpretation identified, Bob Martin (2016) positively argues that the idea behind the manifesto is still valid.\nPoor implementation of agile # When Kent Beck invented XP, he intended to make the world safer for programmers. Ron Jeffries believes that nowadays, “agile is not making the world safer for programmers” (Lockard et al. 2017). One participant [Anonymous] identifies management pressure as one reason for a lot of careless software “craftsmanship” on the developer’s level. Jeff Sutherland points out that there is a “lot of sloppy software craftsmanship [because of] management pressure” (Lockard and Gifford 2017a). This often creates a huge mess since the agile approach is not tailored to the specific context. Jeff Sutherland (2017a) mentions that there are many teams outside without working software. According to Arie van Bennekum, often “teams deliver [software] and then use the following sprint for test” (Hohl 2017). In addition, Mike Beedle is disappointed because many people “maybe just have misunderstood [the concepts of agile] and doing [it] on the cheap” (Lockard and Gifford 2016a). The problem he points out is that “people want solutions and people want an execution plan” (Lockard and Gifford 2016a). Organizations which want to retain their hierarchy often try to introduce Scrum by the book to speed up development [Anonymous]. Furthermore, Mike Beedle states that “agile is about the understanding, what makes sense” (Lockard and Gifford 2016a). John Kern emphasizes to view agile methods and practices in a more differentiated manner. He states: “I hope the hack that someone building software that can kill you is not following the same process as someone designing some start up bullshit webpage. Please tell me not to follow the same methodology. Whatever it is. To me that’s the difference. Rightsizing the mind-set and be as agile as you could be in your work. Fail safe better be developed with a much more strict process.” (Lockard 2016a)\nAnother possible reason why agile is poorly implemented is identified by Ron Jeffries (2017). He claims that agile has “become a management approach”, and it is sold at the highest management levels. Arie van Bennekum emphasizes that agile “has not only become a management approach” (Hohl 2017). He points out the unpleasant fact that agile is “used by managers because they score points at the board of directors, shareholders and others who have no idea, but have heard the word and trend” (Hohl 2017). Brian Marick (2016c) mentions that before the agile movement, traditional programmers and the management were separated. He mentions that “in agile [\u0026hellip;] both cultures come together” (Lockard and Gifford 2016c). However, “today they split again” (Lockard and Gifford 2016c). This trend can be seen at “agile conferences, where the programmers do not go to the conferences anymore” (Lockard and Gifford 2016c).\nA lot of people claim to be agile # Ron Jeffries (2017) thinks that the “blood has been squeezed out of agile”. Since “agile” is so popular, everyone wants to ride along. Another participant [Anonymous] emphasizes this by stating that a lot of people believe they are doing agile with a 3-h stand-up meeting and a backlog. According to Andy Hunt (2016b), this is how they pretend to be agile. Mike Beedle (2016a) and Arie van Bennekum (2017) conclude that agile approaches often do not work, because the only reason to implement them is that “it is fashionable to be agile”. They Lockard and Gifford (2016a); Lockard and Cleff (2016) identify the problem of too many people professing to know about agile and that many people misinterpret the basic claim of the manifesto. They mentioned the example of documentation.\nThe manifesto does not prohibit documents or processes. The users should just value them less than individuals or working software. Mike Beedle (2016a) mentions that even Scrum is based on processes and has a backlog, which is a document. Arie van Bennekum mentions that it is important to say that “there is no basic issue against documentation” (Hohl 2017)”. He points out that the “basic issue is [the use of] documents [which is] one of the old paradigms” (Hohl 2017). He recommends the use of “Information Radiators”. “Information Radiators do cover information and can be perceived as documentation or a document” (Hohl 2017). From his point of view, the way to document like this leads to the fact that the document or documentation “is not the hindering product as in old processes” (Hohl 2017).\nPreserve the agile origin # Martin Fowler (2017) mentions that a lot of people actively working in an agile way are not satisfied. Furthermore, Ron Jeffries (2017) believes “that all good ideas get watered down in their fashion. Over time, when the idea is getting popular, it is just watered down the ripples lower and lower. Some people get it, some people not” (Lockard et al. 2017). The original manifesto is developer-focused. Martin Fowler (2017) mentions that “the real benefits are [\u0026hellip;] [still on the] technical level”. Therefore, the manifesto does not claim to support executives and business owners [Anonymous].\nAgile certifications and agile coaches # What comes along with the spreading of the agile ideas are certifications like the Scrum Master. Bob Martin denotes the idea of certification introduced by Ken Schwaber as a “great service [\u0026hellip;] [and] marketing scheme that just opened the flood gates” (Lockard and Gifford 2016) for the agile movement. Its drawback is a massive number of people who attend a 2-day “agile” course. In the end, they get a certification which makes them agile in their opinion (Lockard and Gifford 2016). There is a big issue with certified agile coaches who are unable to overcome stereotypical thinking [Anonymous]. According to Arie van Bennekum (2016), the agile movement was getting so big that there was a need for coaches to help organizations to overcome the old paradigms and replace them by new ones in order to be agile. He also mentions certifications by non-profit organizations as a benefit (Lockard and Cleff 2016). According to Brian Marick (2016c), Agile and Scrum are a “brand rather than a mindset”, and the craft of software development has been lost.\nNew agile trends arise # Since 2001, the original ideas of the manifesto have become more and more commercialized and different trends have arisen. New trends like Scrum of Scrums (SoS) or the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) are common talk. Ron Jeffries mentions that “the agile ideas are [\u0026hellip;] often adopt[ed] as roots” (Lockard et al. 2017), which forces the development into frameworks like SAFe. According to Ron Jeffries, “it is depressive” (Lockard et al. 2017), because programmers “have to do [the same] stuff every week” (Lockard et al. 2017). He further calls this the “dark scrum” (Lockard et al. 2017). Arie van Bennekum points out that “scaling Agile is [\u0026hellip;] a non-issue” (Lockard and Cleff 2016). He elucidates that the success of the agile scaling frameworks resulted from the misbelief that “there was no full delivery method in the time when the agile manifesto came out” (Lockard and Cleff 2016). He mentions that “there was DSDM, including full delivery of needed business value and the required business change” (Lockard and Cleff 2016). As he defines, “Agile is about delivering better business value earlier with a better internal quality” (Hohl 2017). Sticking to the old paradigms and processes will not help. He points out that “being Agile makes you [and your company] future-proof” (Hohl 2017). Mike Beedle confirms this, saying that “the rate of change in the world has so increased” (Lockard and Gifford 2016a). He furthermore points out that “this is a world of rapid change” which needs “new way[s] of management techniques” (Lockard and Gifford 2016a).\nTake aways for research question 2: # Martin Fowler mentions that it is important to remember the “long list of people, who were pushing agile in that time” (Lockard 2017).\nFurther important takeaways for current view on the agile manifesto:\nThe success of the manifesto for agile software development took off faster than all authors of the manifesto anticipated. The majority of the authors would not change the wording of the manifesto. It is a difference between “doing agile” and “being agile”. Agile methods and practices are often poorly implemented. A lot of people claim to be agile, because it is fashionable to “be agile”. It is important to preserve the origin of the agile manifesto. Agile certifications and agile coaches, both a blessing and a curse. A world of rapid change needs new ways of management techniques. Research question 3: views on future of the agile manifesto # What do the original authors think about the manifesto’s future?\nAs we figured out, there are two different views on the future of the manifesto. One supports the adaption of the manifesto to different domains in and outside the area of software engineering. The other one takes a critical stance on it. This latter viewpoint is based on the ongoing commercialization of selling “agile” and a loss of the sharpness of the core ideas. In addition, one participant emphasizes the first sentence of the manifesto where the very first line says “We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it” (Beck et al. 2001). What Steve Mellor likes to see in future directions of the manifesto is the awareness on “how they could make their process, their abstraction in turning more towards reality” (Lockard and Gifford 2017).\nOne participant mentions that the manifesto sets a standard of values and principles most people ignore. He does not see any sense in updating it. Arie van Bennekum refers to the fact that “too many people use the word without understanding” (Hohl 2017). Furthermore he mentions that “too many of so called agile experts did not read the manifesto or investigate other methods then Scrum” (Hohl 2017). For the future of agile software development, Jeff Sutherland states that he does not “know any better ways to do software than scrum” (Lockard and Gifford 2017a), but he is not focusing on the future trends right now.\nHowever, there have been some thoughts about a rework or version 2 of the manifesto. Bob Martin (2016) does not believe that any of the original authors are interested in doing that. In 2011, though, Kent Beck published his “beyond agile manifesto” (Denning 2011):\nIn 2011 Kent Beck proposed that even a great manifesto needs to evolve and that this might be the next step:\nTeam vision and discipline over individuals and interactions (over processes and tools)\nValidated learning over working software (over comprehensive documentation)\nCustomer discovery over customer collaboration (over contract negotiation)\nInitiating change over responding to change (over following a plan)\nThe importance of team vision and discipline is also acknowledged by Arie van Bennekum. He points out that “the success in agile comes with the quality and discipline you apply using the agile rituals and concept” (Hohl 2017). Ron Jeffries (2017) mentions the loss of the sharpness of the core ideas by spreading agile and selling it to large enterprises.\nTake aways for research question 3: # Two different views on the future of the manifesto exist. Some authors stop focusing on the future trends of the agile manifest. Some authors support the distribution of the agile mindset into new fields of application. Research question 4: the future directions of agile software development # What do the original authors think about the future of agile software development?\nScrum is not the end of the road for being agile # Steve Mellor had “been expecting agile to reach the top of the hype curve, for a good 5 years now. And there are two hype curves, the marketing hype curve, and a very similar curve which has to do with the underlying technology” (Lockard and Gifford 2017). Andy Hunt states that “Scrum is not the end of the road for being agile, neither XP” (Lockard and Gifford 2016b). Mike Beedle (2016a) identifies the agile ideas as a good starting point for further improvements. In a changing world, the evolution of agile software development is still going on. Brian Marick mentions that “the agile train keeps moving” (Lockard and Gifford 2016c).\nStay flexible and deliver high quality outcomes # Ron Jeffries (2017) hopes that the future of agile comprises continuous innovation and pushing the boundaries. As Arie van Bennekum emphasizes, “one of the characteristic of Agile is continuous improvement and learning. This means agile will not, cannot, stay as it is” (Hohl 2017). Organizations want to become more agile, especially from the business view. Increasing business agility will go on for many years, combined with flexible leadership. Nevertheless, all ideas such as short cycles or a closer collaboration with the customer are based on agile (Lockard and Gifford 2017c). According to one participant, the used agile method itself is not important [Anonymous]. One should focus on selecting the right principles. What helps most, should be used. In addition, Ron Jeffries (2017) would like to return to some values, such as retaining some of the elements from XP that are mostly forgotten in the average installation.\nThe rapid change in agile adoptions is seen as a problem by another participant. If organizations spontaneously restructure the development process towards an agile development, appoint a Scrum Master and develop differently, this will not work (Lockard and Gifford 2016b). Ron Jeffries (2017) claims that it is the first priority to focus on automatic and reliable software releases. Andy Hunt adds that, “if you cannot get software automatically and reliably out of your pipeline for continuous delivery, if you cannot do this mechanically, then all the other stuff like talking to users and so on does not matter” (Lockard and Gifford 2016b). In contrast, Jon Kern states: “I don’t have to suffer doing stupid stuff and focus on delivering value more quickly. Respecting each other, the client, sustainable pace, I think that will make a better environment. I hope we made it not suck as much as it might.” (Lockard 2016a)\nOne participant claims that the level of abstraction slowly increases [Anonymous]. As a consequence, software should become less “precious”. Many of the ills come from the mistaken notion that because the software code was hard to implement, it should be protected against changes [Anonymous]. Instead, it is important to realize that software is ephemeral. He recommends focusing on writing software that is easy to replace.\nBe professional # As one participant denotes there is a need for professionalism and software “craftsmanship”. People should be proud of the job they do, tackling it with more personal responsibility and self-respect. “We don’t have to be hackers, we don’t have to be horrible coders by disappointing people every time we release software. We can be professionals. And that is the attitude I want to see, pushed out from snowbird, from the agile community, into the industry at large, I think we have a really big problem there” (Lockard and Gifford 2016). Furthermore, one participant [Anonymous] hopes that over time more people will discover the principles of agile and benefit from them. He predicts that agile ideas will permeate business, but he is aware of the fact that this is a slow and uncertain process. Furthermore, Brian Marick (2016c) adds his opinion on the tendency in agile projects to select methods. The ensuing homogeneity is detrimental for the working process. He argues that there is probably untapped potential for making an explicit goal, instead of figuring out, how to make everyone the same. Different people work more productively together [Anonymous].\nTake aways for research question 4: # The agile train keeps moving, Scrum is not the end of the road. Maintain flexibility, stop doing stupid stuff and focus on delivering value more quickly. Be professional. Discussion # This publication aims at preserving the initial thoughts of the original contributors of the manifesto, to elicit their viewpoint of the future of the manifesto and agile development in general. The results provide deep insights into the history and current status of the manifesto and on agile software development based on the thoughts of the original authors of the manifesto. This publication is separated into four logical parts, the influences and intentions which led to the manifesto, the original authors’ thoughts about the manifesto today, the future of the agile manifesto and the future of agile development in general.\nThe first part provides an overview on agile practices and methods that had an influence on the manifesto. In 2001, various different development processes, methods and practices were in use. The original contributors recognized the need and the potential of lightweight processes. Therefore, a meeting was initiated with interested developers and researchers to discuss lightweight processes. In the meeting, they identified common areas of their used methodologies. It results in a higher-level guideline, summarized in the agile manifesto. Arie van Bennekum pointed out, “they all share two common treats: the aim to diminish bureaucracy and a focus on valuable deliverables”. Some authors mentioned that it was the right time and the right people to set up the manifesto [Anonymous]. However, one could ask the hypothetical question, if the manifesto would be existing or in a different shape, if the participants were different. Some invited participants could not take an active part in the meeting. From current viewpoint, the success of the agile movement confirms that this is the right approach. Martin Fowler mentions that it is important to remember the “long list of people, who were pushing agile in that time” (Lockard 2017).\nThe second part of the publication elaborated what the original authors think about the manifesto today. It helps to clarify whether the interpretations of the manifesto are still valid and represent the original ideas. Since 2001, the success of the manifesto for agile software development took off faster than all authors of the manifesto anticipated. However, agile methods and practices are often poorly implemented. In 2002, Abrahamsson et al. (2002) analyzed ten methods such as Extreme Programming and Scrum which are characterized as “being agile”. The original authors also emphasize the difference between “doing agile” and “being agile”. They further mention that a lot of people claim to be agile, because it is fashionable. They emphasize the importance to preserve the origin of the agile manifesto. Therefore, the majority of the authors would not change the wording of the manifesto.\nThe third part focuses on thoughts about the manifesto’s future and deals with the necessity of new concepts and adjustments of the manifesto. We identified two different views on the future of the manifesto. On the one hand, some authors stop focusing on the future trends of the manifesto. They mention that they do not follow the latest trends in Agile. They state that the agile manifesto shall remain as it is and are good with it. On the other hand, some contributors support the distribution of the agile mindset into new fields of application. Bob Martin (2016) does not believe that any of the original authors are interested in evolving the manifesto. However, in 2011, though, Kent Beck published his “beyond agile manifesto” (Denning 2011). We identified this trend of setting up manifestos, such as the manifesto for software craftsmanship4 or the manifesto for async software development5, trying to jump on the bandwagon of success of the original one.\nFootnote Footnote\nThe last part considers the future of agile software development in general. Starting in the area of software development, agile is nowadays spreading more and more into business. Scrum is the most popular agile method (Weber 2015; VersionOne Inc. 2017) and the dominant way of developing software. A lot of “agile on-boarders” identify Scrum as the only method. Other techniques and agile principles are often not considered any more or are simply unknown.\nOur study aims at giving an overview of the basics behind the agile manifesto. However, we limit the results to the opinions of the originators. In particular, the statements do not necessarily reflect our personal opinion.\nThe study revealed, how the agile mindset evolved since 2001. Influence factors, such as commercialization of agile certifications directed the agile mindset towards, what is today. Nowadays, agile has become a buzzword for “having fun at work, while simultaniously performing better than before”. With this publication, we want to increase the awareness for the differences between the original ideas and what it is meant to be today.\nThe study results emphasize that it is in our hands to create and maintain the future of agile. Therefore, the publication shall help the readers to build up their own picture of agile trends. We encourage the readers to critically rethink the current agile movement.\nConclusion # This publication presents results from a survey and an interview study in collaboration with the original contributors of the manifesto for agile software development. Furthermore, it comprises the results from an workshop with one of the original authors. This publication focuses on the origins of the manifesto, the contributors’ views from today’s perspective, and their outlook on future directions. We evaluated 11 responses from the survey and 14 interviews to understand the viewpoint of the contributors.\nThe original contributors emphasize that agile methods need to be carefully selected and agile should not be seen as a silver bullet. They underline the importance of considering the variety of different practices and methods that had an influence on the development of the manifesto. Furthermore, they mention that people should question their current understanding of “agile” and recommend reconsidering the core ideas of the manifesto.\nThis publication provides impressions of the manifesto. It reveals the discomfort of some of the contributors with current trends such as certification or commercialization. Furthermore, interesting directions for further evolution of agile development and beyond are identified.\nWith this work, we try to retain this knowledge for people who want to learn more about the original contributor’s view on the manifesto for agile software development. Understanding and a continuous learning is an important step in mastering the basics of agile.\nThe publication reveals many avenues for further research. Potential directions could be the influence of certification on the agile mindset It is necessary to investigate, if employees are doing the agile certifications for gaining knowledge in agile techniques or are they just forced by the agile movement to pass the exam without knowing the basics.\nWe could expand the presented survey to well-recognized thought leaders in the agile community. They have contributed to agile becoming the main stream. Their opinions should be studied as well, especially their view on the future.\nAppendix A: Interview guide # (1) The first part aims at understanding what the contributors have been doing before the meeting in Salt Lake City. The five main topics are covered by the following questions:\nWhat were you doing professionally prior to being asked to participate in the manifesto? What were your thoughts and feeling about being asked to be part of the manifesto? How did doing it at a ski resort affect the overall process? If you were to do it again would you choose a similar location? Why or why not? How were you evangelizing your discipline before the meeting? In addition, ask about the previous work and education and how it led them to the meeting. (2) The second part discusses the two-day-meeting in detail:\nDescribe from your recollection the setting in the room and how the conversation began and evolved. Can you recall how all the different disciplines brought by each individual were received by the others in the room? Do you recall any good debates or disputes that led to valuable contributions to the final version of the manifesto? Were there any values and/or principles that you proposed the were not selected for the final version? If so what were they and why were they important to you? (3) The third part reflects the perspective on the state of agile software development after the meeting:\nWhat are your thoughts on the state of agile 15 years later? The goal was to help others in your profession to think about software development, methodologies, and organizations, in new – more agile – ways. Would you say the manifesto has achieved those goals? If you were to write the same manifesto today, what would you change (if anything)? What has surprised you most in the past 15 years when it comes to the reception and implementation of agile on a global scale? Looking back now is there anything you would have done differently at the time of putting together the original manifesto? With regards to restoring balance and credibility to the word “methodology” how do you think you have fared thus far? What are a few patterns that agile practitioners should focus on to improve the future of agile? For those who are not in IT or “agiley inclined” how can they implement agile methodology into their regular lives? How would you like to see the younger generation of “agilistas” continue your legacy?

Here we evaluate both universal and idiosyncratic characteristics of these biopolymers. We incorporate this information into a model that explains much about their origins, selection, and early evolution. We observe that all three biopolymer types are pre-organized, conditionally self-complementary, chemically unstable in aqueous media yet persistent because of kinetic trapping, with chiral monomers and directional chains. All three biopolymers are synthesized by dehydration reactions that are catalyzed by molecular motors driven by hydrolysis of phosphorylated nucleosides. All three biopolymers can access specific states that protect against hydrolysis. These protected states are folded, using self-complementary interactions among recurrent folding elements within a given biopolymer, or assembled, in associations between the same or different biopolymer types. Self-association in a hydrolytic environment achieves self-preservation. Heterogeneous association achieves partner-preservation. These universal properties support a model in which life’s polymers emerged simultaneously and co-evolved in a common hydrolytic milieu where molecular persistence depended on folding and assembly. We believe that an understanding of the structure, function, and origins of any given type of biopolymer requires the context of other biopolymers.\nKeywords Polynucleotide · Protein · Carbohydrate · Folding · Assembly · Self-complementarity\nPolymers are large molecules formed by covalently linking small monomers into chains. Polyethylene, for example, is a synthetic polymer with molecular formula (–C2H4–)n and molecular weight around 5 million Daltons that is used to make plastic bottles and bags. Living systems are united by their expression and utilization of three types of polymers. These three biopolymers, the subject of this paper, are polynucleotide (DNA and RNA), polypeptide (protein), and polysaccharide (polymerized sugars). Biopolymers have special properties that distinguish them from other polymers.\nBiopolymers:\n(i) spontaneously fold and assemble into precise and highly elaborate yet fragile assemblies with meager stabilities, (ii) spontaneously degrade by hydrolysis in the aqueous environments characteristic of biological systems, (iii) are self-protective against hydrolysis (by folding) and partner-protective (by heterogeneous assembly). The three biopolymer types differ profoundly in their properties and functions. Polypeptide and polynucleotide dominate the functional and informational machineries of life, while polysaccharide is important in physical structure, energy storage, and recognition. The three biopolymers occupy discrete chemical spaces. Yet, biopolymers share many critical “universalities.” An understanding of structure, function, and origins of a given biopolymer type requires recognition of these universalities and the context of the other two biopolymer types.\nUniversalities of biopolymers include the ability to fold and assemble spontaneously. All three biopolymer types are self-complementary and pre-organized. Biopolymer self-complementarity is conditional and can be switched on and off by sequence, composition or linkage chemistry. Biopolymers are chemically unstable in aqueous media but persist for long periods via kinetic trapping. The depths of these kinetic traps are modulated by folding and assembly. Biopolymers are chiral and directional, and are synthesized by condensation dehydration using phosphorylated intermediates in reactions mediated by divalent cations and driven by phosphate dependent motors. Lipids are not discussed here because they are not covalent polymers. However, our conclusions would be unaltered by their inclusion.\nChemical Cousins # In contrast to the usual approach of analyzing each biopolymer separately, we focus first on phenomena that are common to all biopolymers (Table 1). We use the same nomenclature to describe a given phenomenon or characteristic without regard to the type of biopolymer.\nTable 1 Biopolymer Universalities and Idiosyncrasies Full size table\nAttribute Polynucleotide Polypeptide Polyglucose Primary proficiency Maintain, record, and transduce information, catalyze chemical reactions Catalyze and regulate chemi- cal reactions, provide physical structure Provide physical structure, energy storage, and recognition Conditional self-complementa- rityU1 Yes Yes Yes Condition for self-complemen- tarity Nucleotide sequence Amino acid composition Linkage stereochemistry (β- vs. α-anomer) Small number of types of folding elementsU1 Yes Yes Yes Folding element identities Nitrogenous bases Peptide linkage Cyclic glucose Enzymatic capability Moderate High Low Sidechain diversity Low: four planer nitrogenous bases High: 20 amino acid sidechains N/A: no sidechains Sidechain complementarity Yes, base pairing No No Backbone self-complementarity No: anionic, self-repulsive back- bone Yes: neutral, cohesive backbone Yes: neutral, cohesive backbone Complementary hydrogen bondingU1 Unipolar, coplanar Unipolar, coplanar Bipolar, non-planar Net hydrogen bond polarity Large excess of acceptors over donors Equivalent number of acceptors and donors Excess of acceptors over donors Selective self-interaction of hydro- lyzed monomersU1 No No No Backbone linearity Yes Yes Sometimes Strand directionalityU1 Yes, 5′–3′ Yes, N to C Yes, 1–4 Secondary structureU1 Helices, bulges, stem-loops, pseu- doknots, etc α-Helices, β-sheets and turns Elongated fibers Conformational constraintsU1 “Rigid nucleotides,” planar bases Planar peptide, allowed regions of φφ space Conformational preferences within and between cyclic glucose Self-destruct mechanism RNA: Yes (2′ hydroxyl) DNA: No No No Required folding cofactors Cations None None Degradation by hydrolysisU1 Yes Yes Yes Polymerized by Protein Ribozyme RNP complex Protein Polymerization is dependent on divalent cationsU1 Yes Yes Yes Polymerization mechanismU1 Condensation dehydration Condensation dehydration Condensation dehydration Polymerization intermediatesU1 Phosphorylated Phosphorylated Phosphorylated Driver of polymerization motorU1 Phosphate release Phosphate release Phosphate release Retention of phosphate during polymerization Yes No No Biosynthesis # Biopolymers are universally formed by condensation dehydration reactions, which release water (Fig. 1) to link well-defined and modest sets of monomers. Proteins are formed by condensation of 20 types of amino acids. Polynucleotides are formed by condensation of four types of nucleotides. Cellulose, the most abundant polymer in the biosphere, is formed by condensation of one type of monomer—glucose (McNamara et al. 2015). Complex cell-surface polysaccharides contain fewer than 20 different monosaccharides (Gabius et al. 2011). Here we will limit our discussion of polysaccharide to polyglucose, encompassing cellulose, glycogen, amylose, amylopectin, and chitin (acetylated glucose). However, our conclusions apply to polysaccharide in general.\nFig. 1 figure1 Net reactions for biopolymer formation by condensation dehydration and biopolymer degradation by hydrolysis. a Protein. b RNA. c Polysaccharide. All biopolymers are chiral and directional with distinctive ends. Chiral centers (stars, shown in polymers only) and strand directionalities (arrows) are indicated. Blue boxes indicate (in toto) the atoms involved in the synthesis/degradation reactions. (Color figure online) Full size image\nAnother universal property of biopolymers is their synthesis via phosphorylated or pyrophosphorylated intermediates (Figs. 1, 2) in reactions catalyzed by processive divalent cation-dependent motors. In translation, the motor is the ribosome (Trappl and Polacek 2011). In replication, the motor is DNA polymerase (Steitz 1999). In transcription, the motor is RNA polymerase (Fuchs 1976). In cellulose synthesis, the motor is glycosyl transferase (Kang et al. 1984; McNamara et al. 2015; Morgan et al. 2016). RNA and DNA retain a phosphate during polymerization, forming anionic phosphodiester linkages, while other polymers eliminate phosphate groups and form neutral linkages.\nFig. 2 figure2 Intermediates in the biosynthesis of a protein and b polyglucose Full size image\nLiving Dangerously # It is a fundamental paradox of biochemistry that biopolymers are chemically unstable in their native environment—aqueous solution. All biopolymers in water spontaneously hydrolyze to the level of monomers at equilibrium in dilute aqueous solution.\nFold # A random coil biopolymer (an ensemble of configurations) folds, by spontaneous conversion to precise three-dimensional structures characterized by specific intramolecular interactions, low configurational entropy, assignment of functional groups to exact locations and orientations in three-dimensional space, and specific interactions between functional groups. Biopolymers that occupy these precise low entropy states, stabilized by self-interactions, are called “folded.” The ability to fold is a universality of biopolymers. In our definition, a single polymer type folds. Multiple polymers of one type assemble into homogeneous assemblies. Multiple polymers of different types assemble into heterogeneous assemblies.\nElaborate folding and assembly are emergent properties of polymerization, and are possible for polymers but not for monomers. It is a universal characteristic of biopolymers that their hydrolyzed monomers do not specifically self-interact. Monomer nucleosides (Ts’o 1974), amino acids, and sugars do not pair or engage in self-complementary interactions in water. The formation of G-quadruplexes by monomeric guanosine (Gellert et al. 1962) is an exception to this universality.\nFinely controlled molecular interactions allow proteins to fold into domains (Porter and Rose 2012) or fibers (Shoulders and Raines 2009) composed primarily of α-helices and β-sheets (Fig. 3) (Pauling et al. 1951; Pauling and Corey 1951; Eisenberg 2003). RNAs can fold into large domains (Woodson 2011) composed of duplexes, tetraloops, junctions, bulges, and pseudoknots (Moore 1999), which can be rigid (Ban et al. 2000) or flexible (Wan et al. 2011). Complementary DNA sequences assemble to double helices (Watson and Crick 1953) approaching a meter in length with billions of base pairs. Polyglucose assembles to microfibrils of indeterminate length containing multiple chains (Valeri 2010; Cosgrove 2014).\nFig. 3 figure3 The self-complementarity of peptide linkages is the dominant molecular interaction in protein secondary structures and in folded protein. a Antiparallel β-sheet. b Parallel β-sheet. c α-Helix. d A globular protein showing α-helices (violet) and β-sheets (green). e An amyloid fibril showing dominance of β-sheets for any essentially amino acid sequence. Hydrogen bonding polarities are indicated by arrows. Each peptide linkage donates one hydrogen bond and accepts one hydrogen bond. (Color figure online) Full size image\nAssemble # Biopolymers form heterogenous assemblies, containing multiple types of biopolymers, with specific three-dimensional structures and intermolecular interactions. For example, the prokaryotic ribosome is a heterogeneous assembly of three large rRNAs and around 50 ribosomal proteins. Nucleosomes, which are specific to eukaryotes and some archaea, are protein–DNA assemblies. Protein–saccharide assemblies are critical in cell–cell communication, cell adhesion, and host–pathogen interactions.\nDegrade # Biopolymers are ephemeral. It is a universality that biopolymers hydrolyze in aqueous media and suffer a variety of other chemical assaults in vivo and in vitro, spontaneously degrading to the level of monomers and beyond. In dilute aqueous solution, degradation of biopolymers to monomers is always favored in the thermodynamic sense. However, biopolymers can persist for extended periods of time in non-equilibrium states via kinetic trapping; rates of degradation are reduced by folding and assembly. These phenomena increase the depths of the kinetic traps and decrease rates of hydrolysis and other chemical degradation (McKinley et al. 1983; Prusiner 1998; Nahvi et al. 2002; Shoulders and Raines 2009; van der Lee et al. 2014). The mechanisms of decrease in rates of hydrolysis are by depopulating high energy states along degradation reaction coordinates. Folding and assembly destabilize intermediates and transition states of biopolymer hydrolysis reactions.\nTherefore, it is accurate to describe biopolymers as self-protective (by folding and homogeneous assembly) and partner-protective (by heterogeneous assembly). Biopolymers are both selfish and nurturing. These properties delay but do not avert the ultimate fate of any biopolymer—hydrolysis.\nFolding-based and assembly-based protection from hydrolysis, allowing persistence in aqueous environments, is pre-programmed into biopolymers at several levels. At the most fundamental level, biopolymer backbones are pre-organized for folding by geometrically arrayed, self-complementary molecular interactions and geometric propensities to fold, induced by rotameric and steric restraints on conformation. Protein conformation is restrained by the planarity of the peptide linkage and by ϕφ restraints (Pauling and Corey 1951; Ramachandran and Sasisekharan 1968). Polynucleotides are restrained by planarities of bases and by “rigidity” of nucleotides. The available conformational space of the backbone is restricted by constraints on and correlations between torsional angles (Sundaralingam and Westhof 1979). Polysaccharides are restrained by conformational preferences within and between sugars (Stick and Williams 2010). Thus, even as random coil, in which high temperature or chemical denaturants disrupt intramolecular interactions, biopolymers retain a kinetic and thermodynamic propensity to fold. Folding is fast and spontaneous when the temperature is lowered or the denaturant is removed.\nComplements to the Chef # Complementarity # Self-complementarity is a universality of biopolymers. Self-complementarity is proficiency for preferential self-binding, which is the ability to attract and associate with self to the exclusion of non-self. Three-dimensional structures of folded/assembled DNA, RNA, protein, and polysaccharide reveal extensive networks of highly specific molecular interactions in which biopolymers complement themselves.\nThe term “self-complementary” has traditionally referred only to the interactions between nucleic acid bases, such as those in the DNA duplex shown in Fig. 4. “Self-complementary” has not, to our knowledge, been used previously to describe the polypeptide backbone, apparently because the nomenclature for intramolecular interactions of nucleic acids is historically distinct and separate from that describing interactions of proteins. However, “self-complementary” is an exact and accurate description of the polypeptide backbone. Polypeptide selectively adheres to itself via extended arrays of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors that are geometrically matched in three-dimensional space. This donor/acceptor matching is realized by local interactions within α-helices, or by non-local interactions within β-sheets (Fig. 3). Thus, protein realizes self-complementarity in two fully distinct folded states, a remarkable feat.\nFig. 4 figure4 The DNA duplex with sequence GATC in each strand is self-complementary, containing geometrically matched arrays of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors that link the two strands. On the left, the normals of the base pairs are within the plane of the page. On the right the normals of the base pairs are orthogonal to the page. Hydrogen bonds are indicated by dashed lines Full size image\nGlucose in the polymerized state is intrinsically self-complementary. In cellulose, essentially all hydrogen bonding functionalities of each glucose are positively engaged with those of other glucose moieties (Fig. 5). Cellulose and chitin form stable intra-chain interfaces secured by large complementary arrays hydrogen bond donors and acceptors.\nFig. 5 figure5 In cellulose, matched arrays of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors stabilize the folding of (1–4) polymerized glucose into homogeneous fibers. The β-anomer but not the α-anomer enables complementary glucose–glucose interactions in the polymer Full size image\nSelf-complementarity of biopolymers is conditional and can be switched between “on” or “off” states. For DNA and RNA, self-complementarity is conditional on nucleotide sequence, which can act as a controlling switch for the formation of elongated DNA duplexes or RNA stem-loops. Sequences such as r(CGA–UCG) use self-complementarity to form intramolecular stem-loops or intermolecular dimers, while those such as r(CGA–CGA) do not. Complementarity is achieved by hydrogen bonding interactions between nitrogenous bases, and is switched on and off by changing the sequence. The self-complementarity of protein is modulated by amino acid composition. Specifically, proline can switch the self-complementarity to the off state by unbalancing the ratio of hydrogen bond donors to acceptors. The anomeric linkage provides the on/off switch for the self-complementarity of polyglucose. β-Anomers such as cellulose and chitin are self-complementary. α-Anomers such as glycogen and amylose are not.\nMolecular interactions that enable self-complementarity of DNA, RNA, or protein primarily utilize unipolar hydrogen bonds such as those of keto oxygens, amide and imine nitrogens, and polarized amino groups (Figs. 3, 4). The molecular interactions of polysaccharides are dominated by hydroxyl groups (Fig. 5). Hydroxyl groups are bipolar, with the ability to both donate and accept hydrogen bonds.\nPerturbation—Clarification # Although certain amino acids (such proline) profoundly alter self-complementarity of polypeptide, amino acid sequence should be seen as a second-order perturbation of cohesive backbone interactions. Anfinsen described the native state of a globular protein as unique, stable, kinetically accessible, at a free energy minimum, and determined only by amino acid sequence (Anfinsen et al. 1961). However, essentially any amino acid sequence at high concentration forms fibrils in which β-sheet is the default mode of self-interaction (Fändrich and Dobson 2002; Pedersen et al. 2010). Globular proteins in dilute solution and amyloids at high concentrations follow the same organizing principle; both demonstrate the dominance of cohesive backbone interactions under all non-denaturing conditions.\nSeparated at Birth # Although DNA, RNA, protein, and polysaccharide have many chemical and structural similarities, they are distinguished by obvious differences. The backbone of protein is neutral, cohesive, and self-complementary, enabling formation of hydrophobic cores where water is excluded. The backbones of RNA and DNA are anionic and self-repulsive. RNA folds to globular structures with wet, salty cores, while DNA tends not to form globular structures at all. Polyglucose forms dry but hydrophilic cores stabilized by the vastness of the contact area. Protein and polysaccharide folding are largely independent of cofactors. RNA and DNA folding are dependent on cationic cofactors. The specific ordering of sidechains along monotonous backbones of RNA, DNA, and proteins are important devices for modulating and manipulating conformation and molecular interaction. Protein sidechains are many and chemically diverse. RNA and DNA sidechains are few and are chemically homogeneous. Polysaccharides lack sidechains altogether. RNA, DNA, protein, and some types of polyglucose (cellulose, amylose and chitin) are linear, while glycogen (animals) and amylopectin (plants) are branched. Each of the linear biopolymers folds to helical structures (Pauling et al. 1951; Pauling and Corey 1951; Watson and Crick 1953). Polypeptide has been selected by nature to fold predominantly via backbone interactions. Polynucleotides have been selected to fold predominantly via sidechain interactions. Evolution may have found it advantageous to include additional mechanisms for modulating biopolymer properties; post polymerization modifications of biopolymers can modulate their physicochemistry and biological functions.\nAdding It Up # The net hydrogen bonding polarities of polypeptides sum to zero, with equivalent numbers of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. Polyglucose has an excess of hydrogen bond acceptors over donors. Polynucleotides have a large excess of acceptors over donors.\nFunctional Distance # Is it possible to relate the functional roles of biopolymers to their structures? First, one must attempt to accurately describe biological functions. What does each biopolymer type do? There are no bright lines—functional roles are not rigidly proscribed by polymer type. The enormous diversity in the chemical transformations of biological systems are catalyzed and regulated primarily by proteins. Protein contributes enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, structural fibers, adhesives, pumps, pores, switches, and receptors. RNA is used for temporal and specific information transfer (i.e., mRNA) and performs more limited, but nonetheless critical, catalytic functions, for example in the ribosome. By contrast, DNA appears to be used exclusively for long-term and bulk information storage (i.e., whole genome) and transfer. On the whole, polynucleotides maintain, record, read and transmit sequence information. Polysaccharides contribute structure along with energy storage and elaborate recognition.\nRibozymes (Kruger et al. 1982; Guerrier-Takada et al. 1983), which are RNA-based “enzymes,” have correctly assumed a great deal of symbolic significance and importance in discussions of fundamentals of biology and the origin of life. However, thus far there has been no observation of a biological RNA-only ribozyme that is formally enzymatic; there are no RNA-only biological ribozymes that turn over (Kruger et al. 1982; Hutchins et al. 1986; Prody et al. 1986). All RNA-only catalytic elements discovered thus far in biological systems perform suicide (single turn-over) phosphoryl transfer functions. By contrast, highly abundant and critically important ribonuclear protein ribozymes (protein-assisted ribozymes), with RNA-only catalytic sites, do turn over and are thus fully enzymatic. These RNP ribozymes include the ribosome (Khaitovich et al. 1999), RNase P (Guerrier-Takada et al. 1983), and the spliceosome (Brody and Abelson 1985). No catalytic function of polysaccharide has been observed thus far, to our knowledge.\nFraternal Twins: DNA and RNA # DNA and RNA both fold and assemble to form double helices with central cores of paired and stacked nucleobases, framed by external, anionic backbones. DNA and RNA appear similar in chemical representations, differing only by a single atom on the backbone and by a methyl group on one base.\nThe 2′ hydroxyl group profoundly influences folding, providing a nucleation hook for base–backbone association, thus fostering diverse loops and junctions. The preponderance of hydrogen bond acceptors over donors of DNA is partially relaxed in RNA by the 2′ hydroxyl group, which provides a locus for intramolecular cohesion. A frequent folding motif involving base–backbone interactions of rRNA is the GNRA tetraloop. There are over 40 examples of this motif in the large ribosomal subunit of prokaryotes (Hsiao et al. 2009). These structures, and many other non-helical structures, are stabilized by intramolecular interactions between 2′ hydroxyl groups and RNA bases (Fig. 6b). These base–backbone interactions promote folding of RNA into local stem-loops, which are often further stabilized by tertiary interactions (Fig. 6c). Biological DNA, by contrast, is generally restrained to base–base associations, forming long, monotonous double helices (Fig. 6d).\nFig. 6 figure6 The impact of the 2′ hydroxyl group on polynucleotide reactivity and structure. a Reactivity. RNA holds a gun to its own head. The 2′ oxygen is a nucleophile that is poised to attack the adjacent phosphorous atom, cleaving the RNA backbone. b Folding. The 2′ hydroxyl group nucleates folding of complex structures by enabling hydrogen bonding between the backbone and bases, as demonstrated in the GNRA tetraloop. The 2′ hydroxyl of a guanine forms a hydrogen bond with the N7 of an adenine. In addition, the N1 and N2 of the guanine form a hydrogen bond with a phosphate oxygen of the backbone. c Complexity. RNA folds into elaborate three-dimensional structures. d DNA folds to long double helices. In panels a and b, hydrogen bonding groups that do not form hydrogen bonds are omitted for clarity Full size image\nProfound differences in reactivity distinguish RNA from DNA. RNA is recalcitrant to oxidative radical damage relative to DNA. However, RNA “holds a gun to its own head”; each 2′ hydroxyl of RNA is poised for nucleophilic attack at the adjacent phosphorus atom, causing cleavage of the backbone (Fig. 6a). The rate of RNA self-cleavage is modulated by local structure, flexibility, pH, and interactions with cations. Thus, the RNA and DNA backbones have distinctive lability profiles, which depend on many factors including on the chemistry of the cleavage process.\nNature Chose Phosphate # Westheimer suggested that phosphates dominate molecular biology because phosphate is a kinetically trapped (e.g., a phosphate ester), tunable, water-soluble leaving group that can be linked to small molecules, conferring anionic charge and blocking transit across membranes (Westheimer 1987). While correct, in our view this analysis should be extended to incorporate the role of phosphate in mechanochemical coupling.\nAll biopolymerization reactions utilize phosphorylated or pyrophosphorylated intermediates (Figs. 1, 2) in reactions catalyzed by processive enzymes. Phosphorylated intermediates appear to be necessary for the mechanochemical coupling required for processive polymerization. The polymerases that make DNA, RNA, protein, and polysaccharide are nanoscale motors. Translocation is energy-driven; the nascent polymer translocates relative to the polymerization enzyme. Mechanochemical coupling in motor proteins is commonly linked to association/dissociation of phosphate because phosphate has “claws” that reach out in three dimensions; phosphate can grab onto and deform proteins. The strength, directionality, and unipolarity of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions between phosphate and protein cause linkage of phosphate association to protein conformation (Rice et al. 1999; Wittinghofer 2016). This coupling of directed molecular displacement (work) to association/dissociation of phosphate, which is in turn linked to pyrophosphate hydrolysis, has been characterized in myosin and kinesin, in the ribosome and in DNA, RNA, and cellulose polymerases (Wang et al. 1998; Morin et al. 2015; Morgan et al. 2016; Arias-Gonzalez 2017). During polymerizations of DNA, RNA, protein, and polyglucose, translocations are structurally and energetically coupled to phosphate association/dissociation.\nMolecules in Mutualism # We (Williams) have previously proposed that formalisms for describing mutualisms on levels of cells, organisms, and ecosystems also apply to biopolymers (Lanier et al. 2017). Mutualisms are everywhere in the biosphere and are fundamentally important in evolution, ecology, and economy (Moran 2006; Bronstein 2015; Douglas 2015; Gray 2017). The mutual benefit, exchange of proficiencies, persistence, interdependence, co-evolution, and parasitism that characterize relationships on cellular, organismal, and ecological levels have direct parallels in the behaviors of biopolymers.\nA mutualism is a persistent and intimate interaction that benefits multiple interactors (Douglas 2015). Because mutualisms are prolonged and intimate, partners in mutualism influence each other’s evolution. Evolutionary change of one partner triggers change of the other. We believe that biopolymers are mutually imprinted on each other in structure and function via their co-evolution, stabilizing the mutualism.\nLevels of Mutualism # Mutualisms were previously understood to operate at the levels of cells, organisms, ecosystems, and even societies and economies. The eukaryotic cell is a culmination of mutualism between simpler prokaryotic cells (Sagan 1967; Poole and Gribaldo 2014; Gray 2017). Essentially every species on Earth is involved in mutualisms.\nMolecules # Biopolymers satisfy all of the formalisms of mutualism. Biopolymers protect each other from hydrolysis and synthesize each other. Polypeptide synthesizes polynucleotide (polymerases) and polynucleotide synthesizes protein (the ribosome). During essential steps of translation, coding is performed by proteins (aaRS enzymes charge tRNAs), while decoding is performed by RNAs (mRNA and rRNA) in the ribosome. Molecules in Mutualism describes: (i) survival—extant biopolymers are more persistent than competing polymer types, which are now extinct; (ii) co-evolution—biopolymers created each other in an emergent and cooperative environment of chemical evolution; (iii) fitness—biopolymers are more ‘fit’ in combination than in isolation; (iv) distance—each biopolymer type has distinct proficiencies and chemical characteristics; (v) innovation—proficiencies of one type of biopolymer release constraints on partner biopolymer types; (vi) robustness—biopolymer types have been fixed for billions of years, meaning biopolymers compose seminal and ancient mutualism with profound stability; and (vii) parasitism—examples of molecular self-interest and escape from mutualism are seen in amyloids (McKinley et al. 1983) and phase-separated RNA gels (Jain and Vale 2017).\nOrigins of Biopolymers—Origins of Life # Why Biopolymers? # Biology requires polymers. Biopolymers allow processes of folding and assembly to be detached from the required investment of free energy. For biopolymers, prior free energy investment in synthesis is distributed over time and space, offsetting the subsequent cost of folding and assembly. Biopolymers appear to spontaneously fold and assemble, only because of prior free energy investments. For small molecules, by contrast, assembly and investment are directly coupled. The free energy of assembly is paid in real time, during molecular assembly. Therefore, small molecules cannot achieve the elaborate folds and assemblies, based on conditional self-complementarity, that appear to come naturally to biopolymers.\nThe data surveyed here suggest that polypeptide, polynucleotide, and polysaccharide arose by co-evolution. Biopolymer universalities, including (i) synthesis by condensation and degradation by hydrolysis, (ii) folding by pre-organization and self-complementarity, (iii) homogeneous and heterogeneous assembly, and (iv) protection by folding or homogeneous assembly (selfishness) and (v) protection by heterogeneous assembly (mutualism), point to simultaneous origins in a shared environment. The co-origins of biopolymers are consistent with previous reports of common chemistry of monomer formation (Miller and Urey 1959; Oró and Guidry 1960; Patel et al. 2015).\nOrigins of Biopolymers # In our view, observed biopolymer universalities and idiosyncracies support a model in which polymer synthesis by condensation cooperated with hydrolytic degradation, mediated by folding and assembly, to drive chemical evolution (Brack 1987; Abkevich et al. 1996; Hud and Anet 2000; Peters and Williams 2012). In contrast to the consensus, this model suggests that early selection operated at the level of hydrolytic degradation (mitigated by folding and assembly), rather than at the level of synthesis. After nearly 4 billion years of evolution, biopolymers continue to utilize self-complementarity to escape hydrolysis and increase persistence (Prusiner 1998; Jain and Vale 2017; Bai et al. 2018).\nWe (Hud) have proposed that the thermodynamic driver for synthesis and degradation on the ancient Earth would have been cycling water activity (Forsythe et al. 2015), which was and is ubiquitous over the landmass of the Earth. Thus, it seems possible that polymers originated via simple (non-redox) chemistry that remained near equilibrium, rocking gently in the cradle of day/night cycling (Hud and Anet 2000). Synthesis by condensation dehydration is favored in low water activity (day) and degradation by hydrolysis is favored in high water activity (night). The close analogy of biopolymer synthesis/degradation by hydrolysis/condensation in biochemical system to wet/dry cycling in geochemistry suggests that the origin of life, like extant life, was planet-wide phenomena of surfaces, and was not a function of exotic environments with constant, high water activity as in hydrothermal vents (Corliss et al. 1981).\nSelfish Molecules # One can define biopolymer “self-interest”. Molecular self-interest is chemical persistence. Persistence of biopolymers in a hydrolytic environment is enhanced by folding and assembly. Self-complementarity is therefore an expression of self-interest, a method to escape from hydrolysis, a path to survival, and a property universal to biopolymers. Heterogeneous assemblies are expressions of partner-protection from hydrolysis, described here and elsewhere as molecular mutualisms (Lanier et al. 2017).\nThe observed nominal stability, rather than extreme stability, of biopolymer folds and assemblies, suggests that unfolding and disassembly confers advantage in some circumstances. The ability to unfold and disassemble provides pathways for prospecting for new folds and new partners and for recycling. Extremely stable folds and assemblies could persist for some period but ultimately form molecular dead-ends.\nLosers # The juxtaposition of biopolymer universalities next to the diversity of chemical compositions of multiple biopolymer types is consistent with a model of simultaneous biopolymer origins via step-wise evolutionary processes, rather than from direct but improbable and singular phenomena (Ricardo et al. 2004). It seems likely that our small set of surviving biopolymers were chemically selected from diverse competing polymers (Hud et al. 2013), most of which failed to compete successfully because of their lesser ability to fold and assemble. Biopolymers, as indicated by spider webs, DNA nanodevices, chromatin, the ribosome, and cellulose, are masters of folding and assembly. It seems improbable that this mastery arose from good luck, rather than from chemical evolution. Loser polymer types, which were less accomplished at folding and assembly, were forced into hydrolytic extinction.\nIf so, ancestral polymers, which dominated in early stages, would have been supplanted by more successful second- or third-generation polymers. The scenario described here does not ascribe utility to catalysis or replication during the early origins of biopolymers and is agnostic on compartmentalization (Szostak 2017), although it does seem to require that compartments be competent to tolerate cycling water activity.\nBiopolymer universalities are not inconsistent with conclusions of de la Escosura and coworkers, who argue that the origin of life involved a “system” (de la Escosura et al. 2015). Their system, a heterogeneous, functionally integrated, self-maintained, quasi-stationary state allowing for increases in complexity and elaboration, is a chemically vague but reasonable description of our shared environment of cycling water activity and co-evolution, with chemical selection at the level of degradation.\nConclusion # Although biopolymer types are traditionally studied and taught in isolation of each other, we believe that DNA, RNA, polypeptide, and polysaccharide are best understood in the context of their shared attributes and key differences. Recognition of biopolymer universalities explains their structures and functions and points to their origins. Foundational among these universalities is the ability of all biopolymers to fold via self-complementarity and assemble into structures that protect them (at least for a while) from their thermodynamic fate of chemical degradation in dilute aqueous solution. Only by examining biopolymers in context can we hope to achieve a reasonable understanding of the fundamental molecules of life.\nReferences # Abkevich V, Gutin A, Shakhnovich E (1996) How the first biopolymers could have evolved.

The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\nConsiderations for licensors: # Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.\nConsiderations for the public: # By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public.\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License # By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (\u0026ldquo;Public License\u0026rdquo;). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\nSection 1 – Definitions. # a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image. b. Adapter\u0026rsquo;s License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License. c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights. d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements. e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material. f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License. g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license. h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License. i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world. k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning. Section 2 – Scope. # a. License grant. # Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a). Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material. Downstream recipients. A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License. B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i). b. Other rights. # Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties. Section 3 – License Conditions. # Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\na. Attribution. # If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must: A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); ii. a copyright notice; iii. a notice that refers to this Public License; iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable; B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter\u0026rsquo;s License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License. Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights. # Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\na. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database; b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\nSection 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability. # a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You. b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You. c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. Section 6 – Term and Termination. # a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates: automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions. # a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License. Section 8 – Interpretation. # a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License. b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

Abstract # Charon displays extensive plains that cover the equatorial area and south to the terminator on the sub-Pluto hemisphere observed by New Horizons. We hypothesize that these plains are a result of Charon\u0026rsquo;s global extension and early subsurface ocean yielding a large cryoflow that completely resurfaced this area leaving the plains and other features that we observe today. The cryoflow consisted of ammonia-rich material, and could have resurfaced this area either by cryovolcanic effusion similar to lunar maria emplacement or a mechanism similar to magmatic stoping where lithospheric blocks foundered. Geological observations, modeling of possible flow rheology, and an analysis of rille orientations support these hypotheses.\nPrevious article in issue Next article in issue\nKeywords # Pluto Charon Geological processes Cryovolcanism Image processing\n1. Introduction # New Horizons has provided the first geologically useful images of Pluto\u0026rsquo;s moon Charon (Stern et al., 2015), which have revealed that its geology is strikingly diverse (Moore et al., 2016). The Pluto-facing hemisphere, which was seen in the most detail by New Horizons during its flyby, is divided into two primary regions: Oz Terra and Vulcan Planitia.1 Oz Terra consists of tectonically disrupted terrain that extends to the north pole and beyond onto the anti-Pluto hemisphere (Beyer et al., 2017). A prominent series of scarps near the equator separates Oz Terra from a topographically low plains unit, Vulcan Planitia, that occupies at least 400,000 km2 on the visible encounter hemisphere, and extends an unknown distance beyond the terminator (Fig. 1 and units Sm1, Mt, and Rt in Fig. 2). Vulcan Planitia contains craters, rilles, mountains, and other topographic features (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, and Robbins et al., 2018). This region exhibits a variety of textures: a smooth, lobate texture, a ridged/lineated texture, and mottled textures.\nDownload : Download high-res image (314KB)Download : Download full-size image\nFig. 1.

Terrain model in simple cylindrical projection from Schenk et al. (2018).\nWe present observations of these plains from the New Horizons Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI, Cheng et al., 2008) and the Multi-spectral Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC) on the Ralph instrument (Reuter et al., 2008). This work analyzes these observations and examines possible analogs in the solar system, proposes possible mechanisms for a resurfacing cryoflow, estimates flow rheology, measures the orientation of tectonic features, and concludes that Vulcan Planitia is a unit emplaced by flow of icy material.\n2. Observations # We define longitude and latitude on Charon according to the right hand rule and follow the recommendations of Zangari (2015). Charon\u0026rsquo;s positive latitude pole points in the direction of the angular momentum vector and longitudes increase to the east. Charon\u0026rsquo;s prime meridian is the sub-Pluto longitude. Pluto and Charon\u0026rsquo;s poles are defined by Archinal et al., 2011a, Archinal et al., 2011b). Latitudes on Charon, following the current scheme for dwarf planets, are simply positive or negative.\nCharon exhibits a visually prominent belt of fractures and scarps that define the boundary between Oz Terra and Vulcan Planitia. These fractures are highlighted by the solar illumination angle at the middle latitudes where they occur. The morphologic features in Vulcan Planitia are also evident due to the lower solar illumination angle. There is no information on structures southward of roughly − 35° due to the inclination of the Pluto system to its orbit around the Sun. All of that territory was in darkness during the New Horizons flyby.\nNew Horizons obtained extensive stereo coverage of the encounter hemisphere, and those data were processed to derive elevation data from the images (Fig. 4 and Schenk et al., 2018) upon which our topographic interpretations are based. This terrain model has a ground scale of 300 m/pixel, and stereo height accuracy from ∼1.4 km to as good as 100 m in some places.\nThe mean elevation of Vulcan Planitia is one to two kilometers below that of Oz Terra, and the amplitude of topographic variations is much smaller across the plains than in Oz Terra (Schenk et al., 2018). There are a host of possible explanations for these topographic amplitude differences, which could include regolith infilling the lows, or viscous relaxation affecting the landscape. However, little evidence has been identified for these two hypotheses. While there are landslides that have been identified within Serenity Chasma (Beddingfield et al., 2018, and unit La1 in Fig. 2 and Robbins et al., 2018), there are no observable geomorphic features that indicate infilling or movement of substantial additional amounts of loose regolith on Vulcan Planitia. If viscous relaxation were responsible, then we would expect other viscous relaxation signatures (such as up-bowed crater floors) that would be present in Vulcan and not in Oz, especially in similarly-sized craters in the two regions, and we do not. Therefore, we hypothesize that the lower topographic amplitude found on Vulcan Planitia is due to the plains-forming material itself infilling previously existing topographic lows. Supporting this interpretation, the lack of high-standing topography probably implies extensive subsidence of the original ice lithosphere prior to, and perhaps associated with, emplacement of the plains material.\nMost of the highest-resolution images presented here were obtained with the New Horizons LORRI camera. The LORRI point spread function has a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of ∼2 pixels, which meets its specifications (Cheng et al., 2008), but can cause noticeable blurring. This blurring can be reduced through Lucy (1974)-Richardson (1972) deconvolution, and the images that this has been applied to are noted in the figure captions.\n2.1. Surface texture # The surface of Vulcan Planitia is smooth on 100-km scales (Schenk et al., 2018), but its surface is marked with many smaller-scale features (Fig. 2). Numerous low hills, several kilometers across and several hundred meters high, occur on the planitia, often in clusters (Fig. 5). There are also broader domes and swells that produce a gently undulating surface over most of the planitia. In several places, particularly near the southernmost visible part of the planitia, some of these swells form convex sinuous features (‘broad warp’ features in Fig. 2) associated with depressions (Fig. 6 and units Dm1 in Fig. 2): these convex margins appear similar to the convex margins of the montes (units Mob and Dm2 in Fig. 2 and detailed below in Section 2.3) and may similarly represent converging flow fronts as suggested by Schenk et al. (2018).\nDownload : Download high-res image (772KB)Download : Download full-size image\nFig. 5.

At the upper center of the image there is a sharp (apparent) boundary between smooth terrain on the right, and mottled terrain on the left.

Convex sinuous landforms in southwest Vulcan Planitia. Equirectangular projection of MVIC image MP1_0299180334 centered at 339° E, − 22°.\nSome parts of the planitia are densely covered in mottled terrain with a locally-varying characteristic wavelength of about a kilometer (Fig. 5 and unit Mt in Fig. 2). In some places there are sharp boundaries between these mottled plains and nearby unmottled plains, although the nature of the contact is uncertain (Robbins et al., 2018).\n2.2. Rilles # Vulcan Planitia is criss-crossed with a pattern of rilles, identified as small grooves (Stern et al., 2015, Moore et al., 2016 and the ‘groove’ feature in Fig. 2 and in Robbins et al., 2018), which range from less than a kilometer to 3 km in width (Fig. 7). These rilles range from a few kilometers to hundreds of kilometers in length, and in some locations show an arcuate or sinuous pattern. The resolutions of available images are insufficient to determine rille cross-sectional profiles in detail, although some appear to be simple graben, due to their inward facing walls, of meters deep. In some locations, these features display an en echelon pattern and exhibit Y-shaped intersections, consistent with a graben interpretation. These rilles appear to cut, and thus post-date, many of the broad domes and swells. However, the available images do not display unambiguous examples of grooves cutting any of the numerous impact craters that are superposed on the plains unit, or their ejecta. Therefore, the grooves likely formed soon after plains emplacement, before subsequent cratering events.\nDownload : Download high-res image (722KB)Download : Download full-size image\nFig. 7.

The image is centered at approximately 358°E, +3°.\n2.3. Mountains # Stern et al., 2015, Moore et al., 2016 described Vulcan Planitia\u0026rsquo;s mountains. There are two large solitary massifs (Butler and Kubrick Mons) and one cluster of smaller peaks (Clarke Montes). Vulcan Planitia does not cleanly onlap the toe of these mountains, but instead displays a convex, depressed margin that surrounds them (e.g. Fig. 8, Fig. 9), engendering the term ‘mountain in a moat’ for these features.\nDownload : Download high-res image (610KB)Download : Download full-size image\nFig. 8.

Topographic profiles over Kubrick Mons. The shaded portion of the profile indicates the boundaries of Kubrick Mons based on image inspection. The letter labels correspond to locations in Fig. 8.\nButler Mons is the largest massif (Fig. 10), but by the time of the closest approach it had set below the terminator. Butler can be seen in New Horizons approach images with substantial scarps to its east and south. These scarps may indicate a hitherto unknown southern boundary to Vulcan Planitia that might mirror the Oz Terra scarps to its north.\nDownload : Download high-res image (295KB)Download : Download full-size image\nFig. 10. These LORRI observations of Butler Mons show it before it sets beyond the terminator, but its peak remains illuminated in (e). Shadows indicate a height of 4.5 km (Schenk et al., 2018). The arrow is offset and points to the peak of Butler Mons in all figures. All of these are LORRI observations: (a) PC_MULTI_MAP_B_18_02, (b) PCNH_MULTI_LONG_1D1_02, (c) PC_MULTI_LONG_1D2A_02, (d) C_LORRI_FULLFRAME_1, (e) C_LORRI. These are not map projected, but north is generally to the bottom of the frame and east to the left.\nKubrick Mons is also a single massif that measures 30 by 20 km in plan form, and rises 3 km above the Vulcan Planitia surface with a 1 km deep encircling moat (Fig. 8, Fig. 9). Kubrick displays a ridge crest and other sharp-looking ridges that run down its flanks. This morphology on Kubrick (and to a lesser extent on Clarke) is similar to morphologies observed in Oz Terra, and not similar to the surrounding rounded lobate shapes of Vulcan Planitia. This morphology implies that Kubrick (and other Mob units in Fig. 2) is older than the Vulcan Planitia surface.\nThere are also at least two other, smaller features that share a strong resemblance to Kubrick. They have steep sides, and a depressed margin (Fig. 11 and other unit Mob outcrops in Fig. 2).\nDownload : Download high-res image (289KB)Download : Download full-size image\nFig. 11. The arrows point to two smaller positive relief features with depressed margins in the C_LEISA_HIRES observation (LOR_0299175721) that has been deconvolved to bring out features. This is not map projected, but a perspective view from New Horizons with the terminator at the top, and north approximately towards the bottom of the frame. Kubrick Mons can be seen in the lower left and one of the Clarke Montes can be seen in the lower right. The center of this image is approximately 21.5°E, − 4.5°.\nThe Clarke Montes is a cluster of peaks that sit together in a single, variable margin depression (Fig. 12). They stand ∼1 km above the surrounding plains. The northern margin exhibits a 2 km drop from Vulcan Planitia, but the southwestern margin exhibits only a 1 km drop. The east margin does not have a distinct lobate margin, but appears to smoothly grade out from the floor of the depression up to the plains (Fig. 13).\nDownload : Download high-res image (414KB)Download : Download full-size image\nFig. 12.

The dark shaded portion of the profile indicates the boundaries of the Clarke Montes based on image inspection, and the lightly shaded area indicates the basin in which these Montes sit. The letter labels correspond to locations in Fig. 12.\nTwo hypotheses have been proposed for the moats which surround these montes (Moore et al., 2016): (1) downward flexure of pre-existing plains material from loading by younger mountain material (formed for example by extrusive cryoflow), or (2) incomplete embayment of pre-existing mountains by the plains material.\nThe downward flexure hypothesis was explored by Desch and Neveu (2017) and they came to a conclusion similar to one discussed internally by the New Horizons team that the thickness of the elastic lithosphere, Te, would need to be very thin (less than 2.3km). Desch and Neveu (2017) hypothesized that the warm icy material that erupted onto the surface was from a local hotspot that was warming the subsurface in this region, and thinning the elastic lithosphere in the area near Kubrick. The Desch and Neveu (2017) hypothesis is consistent with the rift flank Te estimates obtained by Beyer et al. (2017), but we concluded that such a low Te was unlikely to be correct given the fact that large craters do not display evidence of viscoelastic relaxation, e.g., up-bowed floors. Additionally, the morphology of Kubrick doesn’t resemble what might be expected of a constructional cryovolcano, for example, central depressions consistent with a caldera.\nThe embayment hypothesis is supported by the presence of similar convex scarps elsewhere on Vulcan Planitia surrounding depressions without mountains, as noted by Moore et al. (2016). Furthermore, the arrangement of Clarke Montes and the presence of a break in slope at the base of its enclosing scarp, which is in some locations several kilometers from the massifs, would be consistent if the scarp was a flow front, but not a flexural bending of the lithosphere. It is not clear, however, why the flow would have stopped close to the mountains but not at their base. Perhaps the base of the Clarke Montes changes from the steeper slope of the montes and shallows, but still slopes away from the mountains, causing an oncoming flow to stall before reaching the mountains themselves. Also, the local hotspot hypothesis does not explain the depressed margin around the Vulcan Planitia boundary, but the embayment hypothesis does.\n2.4. Margins # Along the south-facing boundary scarps of Oz Terra (Beyer et al., 2017) that define Vulcan Planitia\u0026rsquo;s northern boundary, the surface of the planitia is depressed by a kilometer or more in elevation within about 20 km distance of the boundary (Fig. 4, Fig. 14, and 15). Where Vulcan Planitia meets the scarps of Oz Terra, the Vulcan Planitia units appear to onlap the scarps, consistent with a surface that was emplaced after the scarps formed.\nDownload : Download high-res image (542KB)Download : Download full-size image\nFig. 14.

Profiles from Fig. 14 with the northern end to the left. The approximate location of the toe of the south-facing slope into Vulcan Planitia, estimated from the images, is shown by the end of the shading. Just to the south (right) of that point, there is an area that is depressed by about a kilometer for a length of about 20 km, before it rises up to the level of the larger Vulcan Planitia. The average elevation of Vulcan Planitia can be seen to increase, and the depth of the margin decreases, as one goes eastwards. In this area of the terrain model, the stereo height accuracy is a few hundred meters, and wouldn’t plot as a visually separate line on these graphs.\nIn the portion of Vulcan Planitia between Spock crater and where Serenity Chasma\u0026rsquo;s eastern end transitions from a graben to a south-facing scarp, there is a well-resolved pattern of closely spaced and parallel rilles and ridges, which parallel the boundary. This surface texture only appears at distances greater than 15 km from the bounding scarp where the planitia materials are presumably thicker, implying a pile-up of flow material where it was thick enough to do so.\nBorrelli and Collins (2018) examined the shapes of the margin depressions along the Oz/Vulcan boundary, and tested a variety of viscous flow and plate bending models. Their calculations did not strongly favor any mechanism, nor were any disallowed. They conclude that the morphological evidence better supports the advancement of a spreading viscous cryoflow instead of a plate bending model.\n3. Analysis and results # Charon is comparable in size and density to several icy satellites of the giant planets, some of which also show resurfacing in the form of plains (although to different extents). Fig. 16 compares the masses and densities of these satellites, indicating whether or not resurfacing is observed on their surfaces. In general, higher satellite densities and masses appear to be associated with resurfacing, although not uniquely.\nDownload : Download high-res image (254KB)Download : Download full-size image\nFig. 16. This plot of density versus mass for the large icy satellites in the outer solar system shows that Charon is typical among this group. Solid symbols indicate those objects that have some evidence of resurfacing, question marks indicate that there is not enough data to determine whether there is any resurfacing. Source data and references for this figure can be found in Table 4.\n3.1. Rheology of the flow # We interpret the lobate, rounded features on Vulcan Planitia to be the result of flow emplacement of the surface. The lobate margins, which encircle the mountains, appear to be the result of viscous flow that has encountered an obstacle. The depressed margins along the Oz Terra scarps also imply a viscous flow, but the difference in width between the moats around the mountains and the depressed margin along the scarps may be due to the different depths of the viscous fluid in the center of Vulcan Planitia versus the potentially shallower depths at the margins.\nTo estimate a viscosity for such a flow in Vulcan Planitia (although we envision many happening simultaneously), we will make a number of simplifying assumptions: that the flow was emplaced from a single eruption event, that the viscosity was high enough that inertia can be neglected, and that the pre-emplacement surface was horizontal (although we suspect that it was not). Under these assumptions, the emplaced fluid spreads under its own weight and the equations of Huppert (1982) can be used to analyze its motion.\nFor a two-dimensional flow, the dynamic viscosity, η, can be derived using\n\\[\\tag{1} η ≈ ρη^5_N \\left(\\frac 1 3 g \\frac {h^3} {L^2} t \\right)\\] Here ηN is a dimensionless constant which is equal to 1.411 for a flow that is emplaced instantaneously (Pattle, 1959), ρ is the density, h is the flow thickness, L its length, g the acceleration due to gravity, and t the time that the flow was in motion. The approximation results from taking the cross-sectional area of the flow to be hL. Thinner or faster-moving flows imply lower viscosities.\nThe quantity ηN changes slowly as the flow emplacement condition is varied (Huppert, 1982), so even taking this quantity to the fifth power contributes only a minor amount of uncertainty. The greatest uncertainty associated with Eq. (1) is determining t, the duration of flow. The duration of flow is a function of the rate that the material cools, and therefore the time that it takes the material to freeze. Schenk (1991) suggests two possible time scales for the rate of cooling. The first is the conductive timescale \\(t_{cond}\\) :\n\\[\\tag{2} t_{cond} ≈ \\frac {h^2} κ \\] where κ is the thermal diffusivity. This timescale is appropriate if the material has a high enough viscosity that vertical mixing is minimal. The second is the characteristic radiative cooling time, based upon a lava cooling model by Crisp and Baloga (1990) and is appropriate if the interior of the flow is well-mixed and radiation from the warm interior (e.g. via cracks) dominates over conduction. The Crisp and Baloga (1990) model assumes fractional areas of exposed material between 0.001 and 0.1 based on values observed for several types of terrestrial lava flows. In this case the timescale is\n\\[\\tag{3} t_{rad} ≈ \\frac {hρC_p} {εσT{^3_0}} \\] where Cp is the specific heat capacity, ϵ is the emissivity (taken to be 1), σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T0 is the characteristic interior temperature. The ratio of these two timescales is then \\({T{^3_0}}σh/k\\) , where k is the thermal conductivity. On the Earth, the conductive timescale greatly overestimates observed flow durations, while the radiative timescale is more accurate (Schenk, 1991). The discrepancy between the two timescales, however, will be significantly smaller on Charon than on Earth, because the likely value of T0 is so much smaller. Table 1 gives thermophysical properties for four potential cryo-fluids.\nTable 1.\nThermophysical properties for four potential fluids: water, ammonia-water liquid (NH3-2H2O), nitrogen, and CO. Data for the first two columns are from Schenk (1991) and the others from Umurhan et al. (2017).\nWater Ammonia-water N2 CO ρ (kg m−3) 917 945 970 990 k (W m−1 K−1) 2.1 1.6 0.21 0.31 Cp (J kg−1 K−1) 2000 2900 1500 1800 κ (m2 s−1) 1.2 × 10−6 5.8 × 10−7 1.4 × 10−7 1.7 × 10−7 \\(T_{melt}\\) (K) 273 176 63 68 \\(ρC_p/σT^{3}_{melt} (s/m)\\) 1.6 × 106 8.8 × 106 1.0 × 108 9.9 × 107 There are other possible compositions for cryo-fluids. Methanol (CH3OH) water compositions (Kargel et al., 1991, Zhong et al., 2009), for example, would also lower the freezing point and increase the viscosity.\nAs an example, assume a flow with h = 2 km, L = 30 km, and g = 0.288 ms−2. The lobate features interpreted as flow fronts along the Vulcan Planitia margin and the moats around the montes have a 1 km elevation, we assume 2 km here to account for a slightly deeper pre-Vulcan surface. We assume a 30 km length because we don’t see morphologic evidence for long distinct flows, but this parameter could assume a number of values. Here we take T0 to be set by the melting point of the substance, \\(T_{melt}\\) , and the results are given in Table 2.\nTable 2.\nParameters based on a flow with h = 2 km, L = 30 km, and g = 0.288 ms−2. Here we take T0 to be set by the melting point of the substance, Tmelt and only show one significant figure for viscosity to emphasize the uncertainties.\nWater Ammonia-water N2 CO \\(t_{cond}\\) (kyr) 110 220 910 750 \\(η_{cond}\\) (Pa s) 1 × 1016 3 × 1016 1 × 1017 1 × 1017 \\(t_{rad}\\) (kyr) 0.10 0.56 6.3 6.5 \\(η_{rad}\\) (Pa s) 1 × 1013 8 × 1013 9 × 1014 1 × 1015 The viscosities derived assuming radiative cooling (∼ 1013–1015 Pa s) are much higher than likely liquid or slush viscosities, but reasonable for glacial ice on the Earth (which is at the low end of that range) and viscosities derived by Jankowski and Squyres (1988) for flows on Ariel (at the upper end of that range). The viscosities derived assuming conductive cooling (∼ 1016–1017 Pa s) are similar to those derived for solid creeping water-ice, but unreasonably high for N2 and CO so close to their melting points (which rules them out as likely cryo-materials in this scenario).\nDue to the much higher latent heat of fusion for likely cryoflow material candidates vs typical silicate materials, κ in Eq. (2) might need to be replaced by a value that is effectively 10 to 20 times less than κ, which would increase the values in Table 2 by an order of magnitude (O. Umurhan, pers. comm.).\nIn any case, such high viscosities suggest that very little vertical mixing will occur, and thus that conductive cooling is an internally self-consistent assumption. Whether other assumptions (e.g. emplacement as a single flow) are correct is currently unclear.\nIf we assume that Kubrick and Clarke are surrounded by Bingham rheology cryoflows, and that the Vulcan Planitia margin depression is also the result of a Bingham rheology cryoflow that was flowing in a direction from the center of Vulcan Planitia outwards towards the bounding scarps that define the border with Oz Terra, we can use the profiles in Fig. 9, Fig. 13, and 15 with the following equation, modified from Melosh (2011, Eq. 5.11):\n\\[\\tag{4} Y_B = \\frac {ρgH^2} {2x} \\] to estimate the Bingham yield strength (YB). The thickness of the flow is H, and x is the distance from where H is measured to the edge of the flow. When we do, we find yield strengths from 8.3 × 103 to 4.6 × 104 Pa. These are similar to the yield strengths reported by Melosh and Janes (1989) for flows on Ariel, and are in the range of yield strengths for terrestrial silicate lavas (Moore et al., 1978). There are a variety of other, more complete models of lava flow rheology that could be employed (e.g. Sakimoto and Gregg, 2001), but our data do not resolve flow margins or levees, nor do they reveal other details that would be important input to models of that nature. Additionally, the results presented here make it difficult to distinguish between solid-state extruded flows and a viscous mixture of liquid and crystals (Kargel et al., 1991, Schenk, 1991), especially in view of the rather poorly-characterized properties of low temperature, multi-phase mixtures (Zhong et al., 2009).\n3.2. Rille tectonics # The rilles within Vulcan Planitia formed either contemporaneously with or following plains emplacement. The morphology of the rilles in Vulcan Planitia is consistent with a tectonic origin, due to their regular spacing, mostly linear character, and negative topography. In addition, the en echelon arrangement of these rilles are consistent with extensional graben (Moore et al., 2016). If the rilles are extensional graben, then their orientations are determined by the stress patterns present during their formation. Consistent rille orientations across Vulcan Planitia would reflect a consistent and large-scale stress field. Charon likely underwent extensional stresses following its formation (e.g. Beyer et al., 2017).\nRilles present within Vulcan Planitia appear to exhibit consistent orientations in adjacent regions. However, additional rilles, with more complex orientations, are present in regions farther from the Oz Terra boundary. Here, we compare rille orientations across Vulcan Planitia to quantify their spatial variations in azimuth (see the appendix for more information). To conduct this analysis, we measure and compare the distribution of rille orientations within various regions (Fig. 17).\nDownload : Download high-res image (738KB)Download : Download full-size image\nFig. 17. Rose diagrams showing the spatial variation in Vulcan Planitia rille orientations. Each rose diagram is normalized, so that the first rille azimuth mode is represented as the longest sector, and the lengths of the remaining sectors are scaled proportionally. The N values on each diagram represent the number of rille segments in each area. The most prominent rille orientation is E-W, which parallels normal fault scarps within Serenity Chasma to the north. Other prominent rille azimuths, consistent between adjacent areas farther from the Vulcan Planitia boundary, are NE-SW and N-S. This data is in a simple cylindrical projection, from +30° to − 30° latitude and 300°E across the prime meridian to 50°E. For more information about our methodology, see the section in the appendix starting on page 33, and supporting data for the rose diagrams can be found in Table 5.\nNearly all analyzed areas exhibit prominent rille azimuths that parallel the orientation of Serenity Chasma. Eleven out of the 14 analyzed areas exhibit prominent E-W rille orientations, and this orientation is the most prominent across Vulcan Planitia. Many areas exhibit rille azimuth distributions similar to their proximal neighbors (Fig. 17). For example, Areas 4, 6, and 8 exhibit rilles more similar in distribution to each other than with those near Serenity Chasma, with a prominent N-S orientation. The variation in Vulcan Planitia rille orientations with distance from Serenity Chasma suggests that another stress mechanism, in addition to global expansion, has acted on the lithosphere in these regions during rille formation. It is worth noting that there seems to be an absence of rilles in the areas surrounding Kubrick and Clarke Montes (also noted by Robbins et al., 2018). This lack of rilles may be the consequence of local stresses associated with these peaks, or from stresses related to the resurfacing cryoflow during emplacement or cooling.\nWe estimate the total strain contributed to Vulcan Planitia from rille formation. Because the rille widths are too small to accurately measure using available images, the strain for each rille was estimated based on their lengths. The maximum displacement-to-length ratio for extensional faults is 0.02, and this ratio has been measured on icy satellites, including Europa (Nimmo and Schenk, 2006) and Charon (Beyer et al., 2017). The increase in surface area for each rille is the sum of the two inward facing exposed fault scarp areas that make up the graben walls, scaled by the cosine of the dip angle. The average maximum rille displacement is ∼ 1 km, assuming the rille walls exhibit 60° dips. The total exposed new rille planform area is estimated to be 6680 km2. For an estimated Vulcan Planitia area of 400,000 km2 to 500,000 km2, this areal expansion corresponds to an estimated horizontal strain range of 1.4% to 1.7%.\n3.3. Resurfacing # Our observations and analysis above indicate that the area of Vulcan Planitia was resurfaced as compared to the more ‘primary’ surface in Oz Terra. However, the manner of this resurfacing is difficult to ascertain. We present three hypotheses below: (1) outright melting and refreezing of the lithosphere in place (Section 3.3.1), (2) lunar maria-style flood volcanic cryoflows (Section 3.3.2), and (3) foundering of lithospheric blocks into a viscous mantle (Section 3.3.3). We favor the latter two hypotheses because the presence of embayed or submerged, intact blocks supports some of the observed features that melting does not, and the melting-in-place hypothesis has some thermodynamic and energetic challenges that would need to be resolved. The cryoflow (Section 3.1) and rille (Section 3.2) investigations discussed above are independent of these mechanisms, and mostly explore what these surface features can tell us about the character of the material that resurfaced Vulcan Planitia, regardless of what mechanism was responsible for causing it.\nThe tectonic structures in Oz Terra are fairly ancient as they cut few craters, yet are preserved via the lack of saturation impact cratering (Robbins et al., 2017). The transition between Oz Terra and Vulcan Planitia appears abrupt in available New Horizons images, but we propose that these two terrains are natural terrain end-members. Between those two end-members are the tilted surfaces of the lithospheric blocks in Oz Terra that directly border Vulcan Planitia (Fig. 4). Similar tilted blocks are observed on Ariel (Schenk, 1991, Schenk et al., 2018). These blocks on Charon represent a point on the continuum between Oz Terra lithospheric blocks that are not tilted, but translated away from each other, and the blocks that we think existed on the pre-Vulcan surface before the cryoflows.\nThe one to two kilometer difference in average elevation between Vulcan Planitia and Oz Terra (Schenk et al., 2018) is difficult to explain. Malamud et al. (2017) without the benefit of knowing that Vulcan had a lower elevation proposed that perhaps Vulcan was a giant impact basin. That could be an explanation, but there doesn’t seem to be any significant morphological evidence that it is the case. Alternately, one could imagine that there was a subsurface difference in properties that could have contributed to this variation. As the ice shell was freezing, it would be a thickening spherical shell, over a spherical ocean, over a cooling core (Bierson et al., 2018). If the poles were colder than the equatorial regions, perhaps due to insolation or early tidal dissipation energy still being deposited in Charon, this might cause the ocean to transition from spherical to a band beneath the surface as the last warm spots were centered on the equator. As the ocean froze, pressure could have built up in the remaining liquid (Manga and Wang, 2007). In this situation, when the ice shell cracked and fractured from the extension, the poles would have a strong ‘support’ but the equator would be weak, and lithospheric blocks would more easily sink or subside in that area. Furthermore, the pressurization may have helped push the remaining buoyant liquid upwards but once it erupted, the pressure was released and erupting material became harder to mobilize, leaving the Vulcan Planitia area just a little lower in elevation than Oz Terra. Unfortunately, there are currently no data that might suggest this situation. Insolation models of Charon based on current day inclination indicate that the opposite is true: that the poles receive more solar energy than the equator integrated over millions of years (Binzel et al., 2017, Earle et al., 2017). However, those models don’t reach into the first billion years of solar system history.\n3.3.1. Melting in place # The resurfacing of Vulcan Planitia could have been the result of a large-scale thermal event centered on the equator in this region of Charon. This event could have caused the existing lithosphere to melt in place at the time of crustal expansion. Such a hypothesis would indicate that Vulcan Planitia is simply the melted and refrozen remains of the pre-existing lithosphere.\nIn this scenario, the montes present on Vulcan Planitia could still be explained in one of two ways. They could be blocks that were not melted completely and simply bobbed and rotated into their present position and then were frozen in place, implying a mostly water-ice composition such that the lithospheric blocks float on the melted material. Alternately in this scenario, their explanation as constructional features over local hotspots might be strengthened and explained as these hotspots being the last remnants of this large thermal event.\nThe tilted blocks at the Oz boundary could be the expression of the edge of this thermal melting event, such that these blocks did not melt or sink, but with disruption at depth in this boundary zone sufficient to severely tilt them.\nA similar hypothesis was put forward for chaos formation on Europa (O’Brien et al., 2002). It required a thin ice shell and tidal heating supplied by Europa\u0026rsquo;s orbit around Jupiter. Charon is unlikely to have had a shell so thin at the time of resurfacing, and probably lacked the strong input of tidal energy. Finding a mechanism to provide a regional thermal pulse is challenging, and so is the amount of energy needed to melt so much near-surface material that is near 50 K today (or lower earlier in solar system history) and can radiate unimpeded to space.\n3.3.2. Cryovolcanism # Voluminous eruptions of cryo-materials are to be expected on midsize icy satellites, due to the low driving stresses due to buoyancy (low gravity) and the presence of NH3 (ammonia) hydrates or other molecules which could provide the needed density relationships between solid and liquid (Stevenson, 1982). This hypothesis advances that cryo-material was erupted onto the low, pre-Vulcan surface from the interior and cryoflows flooded the area, emplacing the Vulcan Planitia we observe today (Fig. 18).\nDownload : Download high-res image (1MB)Download : Download full-size image\nFig. 18. This illustration shows the sub-surface structure of pre-existing lithospheric blocks. The upper figure shows a schematic representation of what the cross-section of Charon might look like under the cryovolcanism hypothesis (Section 3.3.2). The lower figure shows how the lithospheric blocks may have foundered and sunk under the foundered block hypothesis (Section 3.3.3), as the viscous cryoflow rose up and spread out.\nThe icy lithosphere of Charon broke into large polygonal blocks in response to global scale tensional stresses (Beyer et al., 2017). We envision that this breakup was global and also extended to the area that was to become Vulcan Planitia. It is possible that this breakup was more severe in this area than in Oz Terra, or that whatever caused the pre-Vulcan area to be topographically lower promoted significant lithospheric weakening in this area that permitted cryo-material to rise up and erupt onto the surface.\nThe traditional difficulty to overcome with cryovolcanism is how to develop a density inversion on an icy world that would allow cryo-material to rise and erupt. The density properties of pure water ice would cause icy lithosphere to float on an icy mantle, even if it were physically disrupted. Johnson et al. (2017) suggest that salt content and porosity differences may provide such a density inversion. For Charon, we propose that the presence of an NH3 hydrate mixture in Charon\u0026rsquo;s lithosphere and mantle is the solution for getting a density inversion (Kargel et al., 1991, Schenk, 1991, Kargel, 1992, Hogenboom et al., 1997, Cook et al., 2007). It should be noted that the density differences between an NH3 hydrate liquid and its solid (or even pure water ice) are not very large and an NH3-H2O peritectic liquid has a lower density than solid ammonia hydrate, but slightly greater than pure water ice (Hogenboom et al., 1997), but all of these densities are very close to one another, and small variations may allow extrusion of NH3 hydrate even through a water ice layer.\nThe broad surface of Charon is primarily water ice, but Grundy et al., 2016, Dalle Ore et al., 2018 note that at least a few craters appear to excavate NH3 hydrates from the subsurface. Cook et al. (2017) also find evidence for NH3 on Pluto\u0026rsquo;s satellites Nyx and Hydra. Based on these observations and considering the likely incorporation of NH3 in Kuiper Belt objects (McKinnon et al., 2008), we have an expectation of a bulk abundance in the Pluto-Charon system of about 1% compared to water. However, ammonia would concentrate in any primary melt or residual ocean subject to freezing.\nWe hypothesize a possible case involving NH3 hydrates that would achieve a density inversion and support the observations. We assume that beneath the ancient surface of Charon, a subsurface ocean formed and then refroze (Bierson et al., 2018). In this ocean, water would freeze out of the solution first, enriching the remaining ‘ocean’ in NH3 as freezing progressed (Kargel, 1992). This process would leave a mostly original bulk composition (mostly water ice, but with rock and other contaminants) lithosphere overlying a water-NH3 ocean, and would also concentrate NH3 in that ocean, even from relatively small original bulk amounts. If the lithosphere were pure water ice, it would still float on a water-NH3 ocean. However, as mentioned above, the densities are very similar, and if the lithosphere were not pure water ice but was an NH3 hydrate that contained even a small fraction of rocky material, that might enable a density inversion. When the lithosphere expands and is disrupted, the water-NH3 ocean material would rise up above the mostly-water-ice lithospheric blocks. This cryo-material wells up, resurfaces the area and then proceeds to freeze. This newly-emplaced unit should preserve the bulk composition of the ‘ocean’ that it came from, because it would have cooled much faster than the slow fractional crystallization described above. With such a high ammonia concentration, one might have expected the spectrometers on New Horizons to have detected it, but photolysis and proton bombardment act to remove this constituent from the surface over a few tens of millions of years (Cooper et al., 2003, Moore et al., 2007, Cassidy et al., 2010). Therefore, spectrometers on New Horizons would not have detected NH3 hydrates in substantial amounts on the surface of Charon in this case, even though they are probably present not far below the surface. However, the fact that this spectral feature is seen in spectra of the ancient surfaces of Nix and Hydra (Cook et al., 2017) casts some doubt on the anticipated destruction rate, or perhaps the identification of the feature with NH3 or NH3 hydrate.\nIt is important to note that there are different ‘styles\u0026rsquo; of large igneous provinces in basaltic volcanism, and under this analogous hypothesis for Charon we are advocating a style that is similar to the volcanism of the lunar maria where there is an absence of clear vents or feeder dike systems, and it took very-high-resolution gravity data to reveal the volcanic plumbing of the maria (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2014). The other ‘style’ of large igneous province are the large sheet-flow flood basalts on the Earth like the Deccan Traps or the Columbia River Basalts. These mechanisms have a few discrete volcanic centers as sources, and have lavas that flow out over very large areas. Application of this style to Charon would require only a few discrete sources for the cryoflow, and then a large volume of cryo-material needs to stay mobile long enough to cover a large area, which seems thermodynamically challenging.\nThe lunar maria style allows for many ‘local’ sources of cryo-material all across the region, and also explains the lack of large, obvious flows. Moreover, the surface swells that form convex sinuous depressions (unit Dm1 and the ‘broad warp’ features in Fig. 2), could mark eruptive centers, if late-stage cryo-materials were withdrawn.\nIn this hypothesis, the montes on Vulcan Planitia are simply pre-existing areas of high elevation that were embayed by the cryoflows like kipukas or nunataks. These montes are not significantly different in elevation than the high terrain in Oz Terra and could simply be remnants of higher-standing topography in this area. The tilted blocks at the Oz boundary could be tilted due to mechanisms that acted in the pre-Vulcan area related to the subsidence of the pre-Vulcan surface and not related to the flows, or they could have been tilted due to subsidence when the cryo-material erupted from depth.\nCharon need not have undergone extensive internal melting of its ices, but an ocean earlier in geologic time is plausible (Bierson et al., 2018), and it is a natural location for NH3 to be sequestered. Even if non-buoyant compared with the porous icy lithosphere above, internal pressurization (Manga and Wang, 2007) may have led to the eruption of cryo-materials. We estimate that Charon should have accreted sufficient nitrogen (in the form of ammonia, or else converted to ammonia via subsequent chemical processing) to explain such an extensive cryovolcanic unit as Vulcan Planitia. For example, a 400,000 km2 plains unit 2 km thick and of approximately dihydrate composition would require a bulk NH3 abundance of ∼ 2 × 104, about 20 times less than Charon\u0026rsquo;s likely accreted NH3-ice (McKinnon et al., 2008, McKinnon et al., 2017). Sequestration in a global residual ocean of dihydrate composition (32 wt. % NH3) would only yield an approximately 15 km thick basal layer, however, unless there is another source of NH3 (i.e., core organics) or other substances (salts, methanol) are involved (McKinnon et al., 2008).\n3.3.3. Foundered crustal blocks # The above hypothesis assumes a moderate disruption which fractures the pre-Vulcan landscape enough for cryo-materials to erupt. This new hypothesis is a modification of the previous hypothesis in which the disruption is so great, that the individual blocks of the pre-Vulcan surface lose their support and founder into the interior followed by the mantle material rising up under the same density inversion and chemistry arguments as above and resurfacing Vulcan Planitia (Fig. 18). Kattenhorn and Prockter (2014) outline a subduction mechanism where large plates on the surface of Europa are subducted under one another driven by a plate-tectonic mechanism, supported by further work by Johnson et al. (2017). What we are proposing here is different from plate-tectonic subduction and is a foundering block mechanism (first proposed by Schenk et al., 2018) similar to terrestrial magmatic stoping. The lithosphere is extensively fractured, and the resulting blocks sink due to a density inversion and potentially rotate into the underlying material that wells upwards and envelopes those blocks. The erupted cryo-material flows across the surface of these submerged blocks and then freezes in place creating a new lithospheric surface. The isolated massifs identified above would in this case be the tips of such tilted polygonal lithospheric blocks, which stand above the plains of Vulcan Planitia like kipukas or nunataks, as the above.\nThe tilted blocks on the border between Oz Terra and Vulcan Planitia under this hypothesis are explained as transitional between the Oz Terra blocks that are just translated away from each other, and the blocks that foundered, sunk, and were covered by Vulcan Planitia plains material. Of course, in this density inversion situation, when the solid is denser than the liquid, the resulting lithospheric forces will be compressive, and not extensional at the surface, which may seem to contradict the global expansion hypothesis, but this density inversion situation would only happen late in the freezing process, still allowing for global expansion, but may also point to incomplete ocean freezing.\n3.3.4. Strain in the plains # Irrespective of the exact mechanism, the emplacement of warm flows on the surface would result in subsequent cooling and contraction of those flows. As an example, a thin sheet of water ice cooling from 240 K to 40 K has a mean linear thermal expansion coefficient of about 2 × 10−5 K−1 (Röttger et al., 1994). The areal strain resulting from the expansion of this cooling would then be about 0.8%. Water ice expands, but NH3 hydrate will contract, and Croft et al. (1988) indicate that for ammonia water liquid, the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient is about 5 × 10−4 K−1. The areal strain resulting from the contraction of cooling from 240 K to freezing at 175 K is about 2%. This can be compared with the areal strain of ∼ 1.5% across Vulcan Planitia estimated in Section 3.2. On the other hand, if the cryo-material flow is not a thin sheet, but is thicker, then there would also be vertical contraction of the emplaced material, perhaps up to several hundred meters. Given the substantial uncertainties in the properties of the emplaced material and in the inferred strain, this apparent agreement is quite encouraging.\n3.4. Age and sequence of events # Cratering on Vulcan Planitia and other terrains on Charon is discussed in Robbins et al. (2017). This abundance of craters is consistent with an old age of ∼4 Ga found for Charon\u0026rsquo;s northern and southern terrains (Moore et al., 2016, Singer et al., 2016). This age estimate is based on crater distributions and modeled impact rates (Greenstreet et al., 2015, Greenstreet et al., 2016). It is notable that within Vulcan Planitia there are no unambiguous examples of fractures cutting craters, or other indication of endogenic modification or infilling of craters, suggesting that the resurfacing and further endogenic modification of Vulcan Planitia occurred rapidly relative to cratering timescales. Vulcan Planitia appears to embay Oz Terra from the south, and has at least one possible outlier within Oz Terra (Beyer et al., 2017 and unit Sm2 in Fig. 2 and in Robbins et al., 2018). Vulcan Planitia is somewhat younger than the terrains of Oz Terra (Moore et al., 2016, Robbins et al., 2017, Robbins et al., 2018), and we lay out a hypothesized relative timing of features and events based on the cryovolcanism and foundered lithospheric block hypotheses in Table 3.\nTable 3. Hypothesized relative geologic sequence.\nCryovolcanism hypothesis Foundered block hypothesis Subsurface ocean begins freezing, causing expansion of the lithosphere, and therefore breaks up the lithosphere. At the positive (north) pole, this expansion was moderate, and produced what is now Oz Terra (the negative pole might be similar, but we lack data). At the equator, the expansion was more severe and subsidence occurred, creating the pre-Vulcan lowlands. At the equator, the disruption of lithospheric blocks was severe, and the blocks foundered and sank. The ammonia-rich mantle rose up through the disrupted lithosphere and resurfaced Vulcan Planitia. The cryo-material flowed out from many vents and covered the pre-Vulcan surface, embaying the existing highs and covering everything else. This process mostly buried the source vents, but the large depressions (units Dm1 in Fig. 2) could be vents where at the very end of the process, cryo-material was flowing backwards down into them, making them look more like sinks than sources. The ‘rising tide’ of flowing cryo-material enveloped the sinking blocks to varying degrees. Some blocks completely sank, leaving no trace on the plains surface; some did not sink, and the cryoflow surrounded them, leaving the montes we observe. Some blocks sank just enough that the cryoflow surrounded and covered them, but as they sank, that flowing material froze solid before an equilibrium surface could be established, leaving the large swells observed. The boundary between Oz Terra and Vulcan Planitia is the result of whatever pre-Vulcan process created the elevation difference between Oz Terra and the pre-Vulcan surface. The tilted blocks on the boundary may have been tilted by that process or during Vulcan emplacement from the flow of mantle material from the subsurface. The boundary between Oz Terra and Vulcan Planitia is the difference between lithospheric blocks that were covered (in Vulcan) and those that weren’t (in Oz). The blocks on that margin that did sink, perhaps did so to a lesser degree than those in the ‘center’ of Vulcan Planitia. At the Oz Terra/Vulcan Planitia boundary, the cryoflow would have been flowing out from the center of the Vulcan Planitia mass across either the subsided pre-Vulcan surface or across the tops of sunken lithospheric blocks towards the boundary. The flow would have encountered a shallower ‘basin’ near the boundary and this may be the reason for the depressed margin we see today. Part of that outward ‘flow’ resulted in the pile-up feature north of Spock (between profiles 9 and 11 in Fig. 14). After the cryoflow had frozen in place, it would have undergone a cooling period during which Charon itself may still have been in the last stages of extension, and this cooling and extensional force may have caused the larger rilles in the plains (Hillier and Squyres, 1991) that parallel the Oz Terra boundary. After that, the only modification to the plains surface has been impact cratering. That sequence assumes a single ‘ocean freezing’ in Charon\u0026rsquo;s history to drive this activity. This is consistent with the possibility of a subsurface ocean (Bierson et al., 2018) or intense serpentinization (Malamud et al., 2017) resulting in a large expansion event at approximately 1 Ga after formation. Desch and Neveu (2017) have hypothesized that there might be two ‘ocean’ episodes in Charon\u0026rsquo;s history. Their proposed long-lived initial ocean doesn’t seem to agree with Vulcan Planitia formation early in Charon\u0026rsquo;s history, which is constrained by the cratering record, but it does raise the possibility of different episodes in the expansion story above. The Malamud et al. (2017) modeling also indicates the possibility for a secondary, smaller period of expansion. It is possible that there was an initial episode that broke up Charon\u0026rsquo;s lithosphere globally into large blocks. Then perhaps there was a significant pause after that initial disruption, and then a second episode (perhaps more localized to the equator or just this part of Charon) occurred and caused the cryo-material eruption or block foundering. Of course, these episodes can’t be too far apart, or last too long, because Charon\u0026rsquo;s cratering record shows that Oz Terra and Vulcan Planitia have very similar ages.\n4. Conclusions # Large icy worlds in the solar system exhibit resurfacing to different degrees. Other objects for which resurfacing is observed either have limited areas of resurfacing, later activity that overprints the resurfacing, or just poor data resolution, such that developing and then testing hypotheses are difficult. We argue that the global expansion of Charon\u0026rsquo;s surface (Beyer et al., 2017) and subsequent resurfacing were both the result of the progressive freezing of a subsurface ocean. This provided a surface that stands as a witness plate to this geologic resurfacing, without much overprinting by other processes, which was excellently observed by New Horizons (Stern et al., 2015).\nWe hypothesize that the resurfacing of the plains is not the result of a singular eruptive or effusive center from which cryoflows spread out across the more than 400,000 km2 of Vulcan Planitia. Similarly, the melting-in-place hypothesis is difficult to validate due to energetic considerations and does not account for all of the observations. Instead, we hypothesize that the resurfacing was the result of ammonia-rich cryo-material from the last stages of ocean freezing either buoyantly rising and flowing out on to the pre-Vulcan lowlands, or as a result of more severe disruption that resulted in lithospheric blocks foundering (as suggested by Schenk et al., 2018), and the buoyant, viscous cryo-material under those blocks rising up and spreading out. Under these hypotheses, there would be no singular effusive center, but the sources of the plains material would be in many places across the region, and as the material flowed across the pre-Vulcan lowlands or enveloped the foundering blocks, it would create an extensive plains unit (Fig. 18).\nThese observations, and our analysis of them, support the conclusion that the extensive plains on Charon are a vast cryoflow emplaced unit (Stern et al., 2015, Moore et al., 2016, Spencer et al., 2016), similar to those seen on Ariel and Miranda (Jankowski and Squyres, 1988, Schenk, 1991) and possibly other icy worlds in the solar system. Charon fits into the panoply of icy satellites which display evidence for the movement of cryoflows and resurfacing.\nAcknowledgments # We would like to thank David P.

Rille orientation methods and data # We analyzed the rille orientation distribution throughout Vulcan Planitia using the QGIS software (QGIS Development Team, 2017). Each rille in Vulcan Planitia was manually traced using visual inspection of New Horizons LORRI images, and we used the best resolution images for any given area as a guide when tracing these rilles. A line feature class was created with the QGIS software to organize and measure the rilles. The Vulcan Planitia region with mapped rilles was divided into 14 areas. These areas were created as individual polygons in a feature class to define each area. The areas overlap their neighboring areas by up to 74 km, and the sizes of these areas (approximately 260 km in diameter) were chosen so that enough rilles were covered by each area to provide meaningful information in the resulting rose diagrams and for statistical analyses.\nSurface features with topography, like these rilles, are most easily recognized in images with low illumination angles due to the presence of shadows (Binder and McCarthy, 1972, Öhman et al., 2006). The lighting geometry in LORRI images is consistently from the north, which might cause rilles oriented in the E-W directions to be more easily identified. However, it has been found that orientation measurements of topographic features (i.e., impact crater rims) are statistically similar to those taken of the same features with different lighting geometries when the features are manually traced and quantitatively analyzed (Öhman et al., 2006). Since that is our approach here, we find it unlikely that lighting geometry has significantly biased our measured rille orientations.\nThe QGIS Line Direction Histogram application was utilized to create rose diagrams that represent the rille azimuth distribution in each of the 14 areas (Fig. 17). To create an accurate azimuth distribution, each recorded azimuth must represent an equal length of the rille. Therefore, to obtain these equal-length rille segments, each rille trace was normalized. For each rille segment, the angle and length were calculated, and the angle was used to place that datum in a rose diagram direction bin. The associated length was added to the accumulated length for that bin. The rose diagrams were specified to have 36 direction bins, so that enough data are present within each bin for meaningful analyses. These bins are 5° wide, and centered on whole degrees, so the bin centered on zero degrees covers N-S rilles that have an azimuth from 357.5° to 2.5° (and since orientation is really a half-space also covering directions from 177.5° and 182.5°, centered on 180°).\n**Table 5.** Distribution of orientations of rilles in each area. The values are accumulated orientation lengths in kilometers.

Even in everyday life, it is a well-known common word. Then, who could have thought that “xibao” (细胞), the Chinese word for “cell”, was not coined by a biologist, but was instead the inspired idea of a mathematician! This mathematician is Shanlan Li (李善兰), an exceptional scholar from the late Qing dynasty.\nShanlan Li (Fig. 1) was born on January 2nd, 1811 in Haining, Zhejiang Province. He was obsessed with mathematics since he was a child. When he was 9 years old, he found the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art on the shelf. He immediately read this ancient Chinese mathematical masterpiece, and became enamored with mathematics. At the age of 14, he taught himself the first six volumes of the Chinese version of Euclid’s Elements. After the age of 30, Li started in-depth study of mathematics, and began to write books on it. By the age of 40, he had published several mathematical monographs and become a renowned mathematician. His mathematical research represented the most advanced level of Chinese mathematics at the time. Li was also a pioneer of calculus in China (Wang, 2000).\nFigure 1 figure1\nFigure 1. Shanlan Li (1811–1882)\nFull size image In the summer of 1852, Li presented his mathematical works to foreign missionaries at the London Missionary Society Press (Mo Hai Shu Kuan) in Shanghai, and was commended by Alexander Wylie and colleagues. From there on, Li cooperated with Alexander Wylie, Joseph Edkins and others to translate western scientific writings, successively publishing a number of important translations. In 1858, the Press published a translation titled Chih-wu hsüeh (Botany) (Fig. 2), which was compiled and translated by Alexander Williamson and Joseph Edkins, two British missionaries, together with Shanlan Li. As the first translated work on modern Western botany, this translation catalyzed the spread of modern Western botany in China. The Chinese word for cell, “xibao” (细胞), originated in this translation.\nFigure 2 figure2 Figure 2. Chih-wu hsüeh, by Alexander Williamson, Joseph Edkins, and Shanlan Li in 1858\nFull size image For a long time, the original foreign source of Chih-wu hsüeh (Williamson et al., 1858) had generally been regarded as a problem. Recently, studies concluded that at least four original sources were compiled into Chih-wu hsüeh, including Lindley’s 1847 or 1849 The Elements of Botany, John Hutton Balfour’s 1851 Phyto-Theology, Lindley’s 1853 The Vegetable Kingdom, and Volume 1 of Chambers’ Information for the People published by William and Robert Chambers in 1848 (Zhang, 2018). The edition of Lindley’s The Elements of Botany was identified as that from 1849 (Fig. 3) by the author’s textual research.\nFigure 3 figure3 Figure 3. The Elements of Botany, by John Lindley in 1849\nFull size image According to the studies of linguists, most free translations of foreign words in modern Chinese were not invented by Chinese people, but borrowed from the original translations of Japanese authors who used Chinese characters (Wang, 2012). Even common everyday words of modern Chinese such as “science”, “society”, “nation” and “religion” come from the translations of Western languages by Japanese scholars, let alone a large number of academic Chinese words like “atom” and “molecule”. However, quite a few words were originally translated by Chinese authors, with “cell” being a notable representative.\nAcademics mostly agree on the origin of the Chinese word “xibao” (细胞) in Chih-wu hsüeh, the first translated work in Chinese on modern Western botany. The description at the beginning of the second volume of the book (Fig. 4), “此细胞一胞为一体, 相比附而成植物全体” (Each cell is an independent unit, and they are interconnected to constitute a whole plant.), is often considered the paragraph in which “cell” was translated as “细胞” for the first time. At first glance, this statement is not problematic, because this is indeed where the Chinese characters of word “cell” shows up for the first time in the book Chih-wu hsüeh. However, by referring to the English original, we can find the source text “Each vesicle is a distinct individual, cohering with the vesicle with which it is in contact.” is located on page 3 of Lindley’s 1849 The Elements of Botany. The Chinese characters of word “cell” here corresponds to the English word “vesicle” instead of “cell”. In fact, the sentence “聚胞体乃聚无数细胞为一体, 诸细胞相粘合” (The aggregation integrates innumerable cells into one. These cells are bonded with each other.) on Page 1b of the second volume (Fig. 5) is the real origin translation of “cell” as Chinese characters, and its source text is not Lindley’s 1849 The Elements of Botany, but rather “It consists of a great number of cells of irregular shape, which adhere together.” on page 69 of Volume 1 of Chambers’ Information for the People published in 1848 (Fig. 6).\nFigure 4 figure4 Figure 4. Page 1a of volume 2 of Chih-wu hsüeh\nFull size image Figure 5 figure5 Figure 5. Page 1b of volume 2 of Chih-wu hsüeh\nFull size image Figure 6 figure6 Figure 6. Volume 1 of Chambers’ Information for the People, by William and Robert Chambers in 1848\nFull size image A popular viewpoint was that Li understood “cell” as “a small body with a membrane”, so he should have translated “cell” as “小胞” in Chinese. Since Li was from Haining, Zhejiang Province, and “small” (小) is used interchangeably with “thin” (细) in his dialect, he finally translated “cell” as “细胞”. This is why the Chinese word “细胞” was not recognized by the public for a long time (Yang, 2006). However, one meaning of “细” was “small or thin” in ancient Chinese (Xu, 2007), which conforms to the meaning of “cell”. Thus, it is not unsubstantiated to translate “cell” as “细胞”, and Li was unnecessarily considered to have been mainly influenced by his dialect. The main reason why the Chinese word “cell” was not recognized by the public for a long time is that the book Chih-wu hsüeh was not very popular in Chinese society of the late Qing dynasty and had little influence. However, the book was spread to Japan several years after it was published, and had a great influence on the development of modern botany there. The Chinese word “cell” became a botanical and anatomical term after it was introduced into Japan, and later inspired the word “细菌” (bacterium) (Shen, 2010). In the wave of the introduction of Western learning from Japan in the early 20th century, Chinese words such as “cell” were passed back from Japan, which in turn had a profound influence on China.\nThroughout the book Chih-wu hsüeh, Chinese translations of “细胞” other than “cell” included “locule”, “ovary” and so on. Especially, although “cell” was not necessarily translated into as “细胞”, it can be seen that the translator clearly understood the concept of “细胞”, because he could distinguish the different kinds of concepts. Thus, the conclusion (Huang, 2016) that the translator was pessimistic or hesitant about the translation “cell” based on the lowest frequency of Chinese word “细胞” among the Chinese translations of “cell” was untenable.\nIt has been more than 160 years since the book Chih-wu hsüeh was published, and many Chinese terms translated from English have changed to different extents in the course of development. Even for the Chinese terms that are still in use today, the meaning and scope of the denoted concepts may have changed significantly. The Chinese word “细胞” is no exception. Now, it refers especially to the basic unit of the structure and function of organisms, and has almost completely lost the other meanings given in Chih-wu hsüeh.\nShanlan Li, a well-known mathematician of the late Qing dynasty, participated in the translation and publication of many important scientific textbooks, covering mathematics, mechanics, astronomy, botany and other subjects. He was also the first person to introduce algebra, analytic geometry, calculus, botany and other modern Western sciences into China, promoting the spread of modern science in China. As a well-deserved pioneer of modern Chinese science, Li is worth remembering by people forever.\nReferences # Balfour JH (1851) Phyto-theology; or, botanical sketches, intended to illustrate the works of god in the structure, functions, and general distribution of plants.

Abstract # The urban history, archeology, regional science and urban economics literatures all stress many different locational characteristics as important in driving city location. The availability of ever better, spatially more finegrained, data on the historical and geographical characteristics of cities, and of locations that never developed into a city, makes it possible to start to enrich this debate with (much-needed) empirical evidence. Using this data in combination with more advanced empirical and computational methods will almost surely give us a better, empirically well-grounded, understanding of the relative importance of the many alleged “city seeds” in different parts of the world and at different points in history.\nKeywords # City originsGeographyHistory\n1. Introduction # City origins are often of shrouded in myth, legend or acts of divine or heroic proportion. The legendary foundations of cities as diverse as Athens, Uruk, Rome, Tenochtitlan, Carthage, Varanasi, Alexandria, Babylon, Eridu, and Cuzco all involve acts of divine intervention, or omens pointing to the best city location. These foundation legends give us clues as to what the gods or heroes were looking for when founding their city, or when convincing the people to found a city in their name instead of that of a competitor, but it is archeologists and urban historians, notably the early work of Weber (1922), Pirenne (1925), Childe (1950), Mumford (1961), Bairoch (1988) that started to systematically document the important reasons for cities to develop in some locations and not in others.7\nGeography is the predominant determinant of city location stressed in this literature. However, the exact geographical features of importance mentioned are many, and they often differ between different parts of the world at different points in history. Generally speaking, with the advancement of human technology, more and more locations qualified as, in principle, viable city locations. Advances in agriculture, transport, and storage technology weakened the link between city development and favorable agricultural conditions; while at the same time advances in medicine and sanitation substantially limited the negative externalities associated with city life. As a result, cities can today be found in every corner of the earth - in some of its harshest climates, and even on reclaimed parts of the ocean floor. Wherever they arose, cities have been great engines of social and cultural change, technological progress, and the exchange of goods, people and ideas (Glaeser, 2011). They are also remarkably resilient. Once established, they typically persist. It makes understanding the important factors that gave rise to cities in particular places in particular time periods of great interest.\nUntil recently, the lack of comprehensive data sets on historical city location in many parts of the world meant that the debate on the origins of cities largely took place without solid empirical evidence on the (ir)relevance of the (many) different alleged “city seeds”. In this overview, I argue that recent advances in data availability and in our (computational) ability to handle this data means that we can start to fill this gap using state-of-the art empirical methods. First, in section 2, I provide a succinct overview of the most important alleged drivers of city location. Section 3 then lays out the basic empirical framework used to empirically quantify their (relative) importance, highlighting two important choices faced by any empirical study into the origins of cities. Subsequently, section 4, discusses the opportunities offered by the fast-expanding availability of very detailed geospatial data sets on historic city location, as well as on a wealth of geographic and climatic characteristics. In doing so, it highlights the promise held by exploiting quasi-random variation in e.g., the introduction of new agricultural, storage or transportation technologies, climatic changes, natural disasters or in the various attempts to plan and build cities from scratch.\n2. City seeds - an overview # The ‘where do cities locate’-question that lies at the heart of this paper, is intricately linked with the question ‘why do cities form to begin with’. The earliest known cities started to emerge following the Neolithic Revolution. The surplus-food production associated with the spread of agriculture led to denser human populations. It also made it increasingly possible for large numbers of people to specialize in other activities than farming, hunting, or gathering food, leading to more complex human societies. In this context, clustering together in cities, or large settlements, provided several clear benefits, explaining their emergence. Importantly, they facilitate the easier provision of public goods, notably centralized food storage, canals and irrigation- or water-storage systems, safety and protection, the organization of long-distance trade, and (building) activities of religious nature.\nIn this context, the locational characteristics that are widely seen as important “city seeds” are either related to a location\u0026rsquo;s ability to sustain denser human populations, or to its defensive or trade-related advantages. Over the course of history, technological advances in agriculture, transport, and storage capabilities weakened the link between city development and favorable agricultural conditions, resulting in a location\u0026rsquo;s trade-related benefits becoming a more prominant determinant of city location. It also facilitated the “top-down” planning of city locations as part of a country\u0026rsquo;s broader development (or political) agenda, leading to the creation of cities in sometimes unexpected places. I discuss these different “city seeds” in turn below.8\n2.1. Food, water and building material # When transportation costs are high, a city can only arise in a location if it is able to provide enough food, water and building material for its citizens. This first of all means that a location\u0026rsquo;s soil quality and climatic conditions need to make it possible to grow substantial agricultural surpluses so that a relatively small number of farmers can feed the large number city dwellers whose primary activity is not the gathering, growing or hunting of food. As such, soil and climatic conditions that allow for the production of sufficiently large surpluses of high-yield, energy-rich cereals suitable for long-term storage (grains, rice, maize, etc) are particularly good city seeds.\nThe availability of a reliable source of water is vital to meet the demand for fresh drinking water of the cities\u0026rsquo; inhabitants and their livestock, as well as for water needed for agricultural purposes. A location close to a river, lake or other source of fresh water is thus particularly attractive, as one can simply take the water directly from its source or, with relatively little effort, built an irrigation or water-storage system harnessing the water for dryer times. On top of this, direct access to a river or lake provides a source of fish, and an easy means to dispose of the city\u0026rsquo;s waste.9\nFinally, an important prerequisite for the formation of a city is the availability of sufficient building material, wood and stone, for the city\u0026rsquo;s structures. Wood, moreover, served, for the largest part of human history, as the most important energy source used for heating, cooking, and metal smelting. And, given the (prohibitively) expensive transportation of large quantities of timber or stone, cities developed in places where these materials were readily available in close proximity. It is one of the explanations for why, for the most part of history, only (very) few cities can be found in the world\u0026rsquo;s grasslands, savannas, or steppes where (large) trees do not grow very well.10\n2.2. Military advantage # Cities’ ability to provide safety and protection to its inhabitants made locations providing a particular military advantage attractive places for city development. A strategic location on a hill overlooking the surrounding countryside, an easily defendable location sheltered from attacks on multiple sides, or the narrowest part of a strait or sound where one can easily control the passing river- or maritime traffic, are good examples of such locations. Often, a fortress or military camp was first established in such places, attracting people and economic activity from the surrounding area, eventually developing into a town or city.\n2.3. Trade: hubs, mineral resources, and market access # Cities have always been centres of trade; from the earliest cities’ trade between its citizens and its hinterland farmers, to the, ever more important, (very) long-distance trade between different cities, countries, or even continents. Cities are therefore frequently found on navigable rivers, near natural harbors, or on the important overland transit routes, be it the caravan routes in Central Asia, India and North America, the easiest traversed routes across a mountain ranges, or the lowest cost routes to build roads or, later, railways.11\n2.3.1. Hubs # Of particular interest are locations from which one can easily control these trade routes, and/or places where one can easily switch between different modes of transport. Natural harbors near the mouth of a navigable river, a conjunction of rivers, places where a river can be forded or where it is easier to build bridges, the beginning/end of a route traversing important mountain passes, or an oasis-type location providing abundant fresh water for overland travellers, are important examples. These “hubs” act as natural gravitational points for economic activity and as a result we find cities in many such locations.\n2.3.2. Mineral resources # For most of history, mineral resources constituted some of the most heavily traded commodities. Many mineral resources occur in a spatially concentrated manner. These localized deposits acted as strong focal points for economic activity, often even if in remote or unfriendly environments. As a result, a town or city frequently developed in close proximity to the mineral deposit. This holds true for the various different minerals that have, sometimes to a varying degree, been important throughout human history: salt, iron, gold, copper, silver, marble, granite, and more recently, coal, oil, cobalt, lithium, or nickel.\n2.3.3. Location theory and quantitative spatial economics # Trade (costs) also play a crucial role in the early location theories (e.g. von Thünen (1826), Christaller (1933), Lösch (1938, 1941), as well as in the more recent quantitative spatial economic models developed in the urban and regional economics literature (notably the early work by Krugman (1993) and Fujita and Mori (1996, 1997); for more recent contributions see e.g., Konishi (2000), de Palma et al. (2019), Redding and Rossi-Hansberg (2017), or Allen and Donaldson (2021)).12\nWhen the agglomeration benefits associated with urban density are low, and trade costs are high, this results in the so-called tyranny of distance (Duranton, 1999), and cities will, if at all, only develop in places where sufficient water, food and building material can be sourced from its immediate hinterland. But, when trade costs fall and/or agglomeration benefits strengthen, it becomes increasingly attractive to establish cities in new locations that were, given their own geographical characteristics, previously unsuitable for city development. Locations at intermediate distance from an already existing city in particular are predicted to be the most likely candidates for a new city to emerge. They face fewer competition with the existing city than locations at closer distance to that city,13 while at the same time being better placed to take advantage of the trading possibilities that the already existing city offers compared to locations at further distance.14\n2.4. Policy - planned cities # Throughout history city formation has mostly been a gradual process. Once a region is able to generate sufficient agricultural surplus, we see the formation of permanent settlements, some of which continue to grow into larger towns and cities because of one, or more, favorable geographic characteristics. In sharp contrast to these cities stand what I will refer to as “planned cities”: cities whose location is centrally planned by the government or ruler(s) in charge of the territory. When planning the location for the new city (or cities), the government does of course not disregard locations’ geographical characteristics, but other (political or economic) motives often play a more crucial role. These planned cities can be broadly classified these into two different categories:\n2.4.1. Capital cities # The aim of founding a new (regional) capital city was often either to signify a break with the past following the transition of power from one government or ruler to the next, to consolidate control over newly acquired territory, or, when governing an ethnically, religious or otherwise diverse country to avoid having a capital city that is viewed as ‘belonging to’ one of these groups. Examples of such planned capital and administrative cities can be found throughout the world.15 Not infrequently, they are founded either in the geographic middle of the territory they govern, in economically lagging hinterland regions with the aim to stimulate (economic) development, or in places further away from a countries\u0026rsquo; borders or coastline that are less vulnerable from attack by foreign powers.\n2.4.2. Industrial/urbanization/regional development policy # The second category constitutes cities planned as part of a country\u0026rsquo;s wider industrialization, urbanization or regional development strategy. Such cities are a much more recent phenomenon, with notable examples being Russia\u0026rsquo;s Monotowns (Shkvarikov et al., 1964), China\u0026rsquo;s manufacturing towns, or India\u0026rsquo;s new settlements built to promote industrialization in lagging regions in the early-to-mid 20th century. Many of these planned industrial cities can be found near or within easy reach of a valuable natural resource, with their economy heavily (over)reliant on the extraction and processing of that natural resource. Moreover, they are not necessarily found near the country\u0026rsquo;s (largest) already existing, economically most advanced cities. On the contrary, in many cases these planned cities involved the (sometimes involuntary) move of people and resources to places that would otherwise most likely not have witnessed any urban development given their (extreme) remoteness.\nA different type of centrally planned cities are those built in response to the rising population pressure, and resulting social challenges in existing cities, during the period after WWII in e.g. the United States (Title VII New Towns), Britain (New Towns), France (Ville Nouvelles), or The Netherlands (Groeikernen/New Towns). These new towns are often found within easy reach of a (large) already-existing city giving their inhabitants good access to the jobs and amenities in that city while avoiding the disamenities of large-city life itself (crime, congestion, higher cost of living).\nIn many of today\u0026rsquo;s rapidly urbanizing, emerging, economies in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, we still witness the planned establishment of new cities (see e.g., van Noorloos and Kloosterboer, 2018). A majority of these are found near a country\u0026rsquo;s already existing (larger) cities, and not in unchartered urban territory. An important reason for this is that most emerging economies\u0026rsquo; industrial policies are no longer aimed at attracting heavy (manufacturing) industries, but specialized tech-, finance, or other high-value added service firms instead. Attracting a highly skilled workforce is considered to be crucial for the success of such policies, explaining why good access to (inter)national markets as well as geographical characteristics related to urban amenities (climate, landscape) appear to matter heavily in choosing the location of these new city developments.16\n3. Empirical evidence - moving beyond descriptives # The combined insights from the archeology, urban history as well as urban and regional economics literatures, summarized in the previous section, provide a variety of reasons that led to city development in particular locations and not in others. However, we still mostly lack (solid) empirical evidence into the (relative) importance of these various different city seeds stressed in the literature. Lack of data is mostly to blame for this. This started to change with the important work of urban historians putting together comprehensive data sets on the size and location of cities in various parts of the world at different points in history (notably, Chandler and Fox (1974), Skinner (1977), Adams and Jones (1981), Bairoch (1988) and Modelski (2003)). Based on these data sets they then paint a detailed descriptive picture of city development in the area and period covered by their study.\nThese descriptive accounts however still provide no, or at best suggestive, answers to the question why cities appeared in some locations and not others. By only documenting the (characteristics of) cities that did actually develop, they all risk highlighting geographic characteristics as important city seeds that, in fact, also characterize many locations that never developed into a city. In the absence of information on such locations, the only thing that one can hope for to convincingly establish, is the importance of time-varying locational characteristics. In that case, a location itself, before/after actually becoming a city, serves as the relevant counterfactual. In order to credibly identify the importance of a location\u0026rsquo;s time-invariant characteristics,17 however, only potential city locations that never developed into a city provide the researcher with the relevant counterfactual.18\nOnly recently, applied urban and regional economists have started to evaluate and address this potential risk of selection bias (see Bosker and Buringh (2017), Motamed et al. (2014), Michaels and Rauch (2018), Alix-Garcia and Sellars (2020) or Bakker et al. (2021) for notable examples). To do so, they all exploit the now readily available wealth of very detailed geospatial datasets on an ever-expanding set of climatic and geographic characteristics. Importantly, these data sets cover all locations, whether they ever developed into a city or not.\nIn the rest of this section, I lay out the basic empirical framework used in these recent papers, describing two important challenges/decisions that one faces when using it to study the origins of cities. Next, in section 4, I discuss the promises that recent advances in data availability, in our computational ability to handle or even generate these datasets, as well as in the use of novel applied econometric techniques, hold for expanding and improving our (empirical) understanding of city origins.\n3.1. Empirical framework # The empirical framework used in all recent empirical studies into the origins of cities can be summarized by the following simple linear regression equation:\n\\[\\tag{1} c_{it} = X_{i}α_{t} \u0026#43; X_{j(i)t}β_t \u0026#43; X_{it}γ_t \u0026#43; ε_{it}\\] where i and t are indexes denoting potential city locations and time periods (e.g. a year or century), respectively, and j(i) denotes a spatially more aggregated geographical unit where i is located (e.g., a region or a country). cit is the outcome variable of interest indicating the presence of a city or urban development in general. Xi, Xit, Xj(i)t are row vectors whose elements contain information on a location\u0026rsquo;s time-invariant and time-varying characteristics, and on the (time-varying) characteristics of the broader geographical unit that a location belongs to, respectively.19 εit is the error term capturing all variables that are of importance for city development but that are not, or incorrectly, captured, by the included explanatory variables. Finally, column vectors αt, βt, and γit are to be estimated. When done so correctly, their elements inform us about the, possibly time-varying, importance of each of the included locational characteristics.\nBesides the usual choice which variables to include and which estimation method to use, any empirical study into the origins of cities faces two very important decisions.\n3.1.1. City definition # First of all, what makes for a city? Any empirical study will have to take a stance on this question in order to be able to define its left-hand-side variable, cit. This question has plagued archeologists, urban historians, and empirical urban economists alike. Urban archeologists and historians proposed a variety of social, economic, architectural or institutional characteristics that distinguish cities from smaller settlements (as an example Table 1 lists Childe (1950)\u0026rsquo;s ten(!) criteria). Many of these characteristics however turned out to not necessarily set cities apart from other (smaller) settlements.20\nAs a result, urban historians started to converge on a more concise city definition that focussed primarily on the size and economic function of a settlement (see e.g. Sjoberg (1965)). This got a final stimulus with the emergence of the first quantitative urban history studies. Besides calling for a well-defined city definition that was useful across all the years and regions under study, they also needed a city definition that was practical or operational. Collecting information on all the important economic, social or institutional features for all cities/settlements considered would be a complicated, very time-consuming exercise. As a result, these studies (quickly) settled on the use of a simple population- or area-based criterion to define a city (see e.g. Skinner (1977) or Bairoch (1988)).21\nMost recent empirical studies on historical city development make use of such a population- or area-based cutoff to define cities.22 The underlying assumption when doing this, is that once a settlement is of a certain size it will almost always feature all the economic, religious, social, institutional and architectural characteristics that urban historians associate with a city. The only important choice to make is thus the exact number of inhabitants, or spatial extent, that makes for a city. Certainly, the “right” cutoff does not exist, and is further complicated when studying city development over many centuries, and in many different parts of the world.23 As such, one should always compare results using different, possibly even time-varying, cutoffs, to verify how potential measurement error, induced by the use of a different (wrong) cutoff, affects our findings (see also Bosker and Buringh (2017)).\n3.1.2. Potential city locations? # The second important choice facing any empirical study into the origins of cities, is how to incorporate all potential city locations, also those that never developed into a city, into the analysis. All recent empirical studies into the origins of cities tackle this issue by dividing the entire geographic area covered in their study into a number of equally sized grid cells, and use either all these grid cells or a random sample thereof as their baseline sample.24\nThe important choice to make when doing this is the size of the grid cells used. The larger these grid cells, the more ambiguous it becomes to construct the right measure(s) of a cell\u0026rsquo;s (urban) development as well as its locational characteristics based on the underlying spatially more disaggregated data.25 Moreover, the use of larger grid cells increases the likelihood that such grid cell level variables are sensitive to the exact placement of the grid. All these (aggregation) concerns can have non-trivial consequences for the resulting statistical inference. From this perspective, the use of smaller grid cells is clearly preferred, especially when the aim is to establish the relevance of a spatially highly localized characteristic, such as location close to a fordable place in a river, a point-source natural resource, or on a hill overlooking the countryside. It allows one to fully exploit the spatially very localized variation in the characteristic of interest, as well as in city development itself.26\nThis is not a call for always using extremely finegrained grid cells however. First of all, cities are not points, but cover a larger area depending on their size. The use of grid cells smaller than the city diameter implied by the population cutoff used to define a city can be argued to be of little additional benefit.27 Second, using very small grid cells implies larger sample sizes that can quickly lead to computational issues, especially when the area under study is large, when studying urban development over multiple time periods, when using non-standard (non-linear or simulation based) estimation techniques, or when requiring the calculation of detailed measures of spatial dependence between grid cells.28\nAll recent empirical studies clearly state how they define the observational unit chosen as the baseline for their empirical investigation. Most do not however discuss the assumptions underlying, as well as the consequences of, their choice of grid cell size. Future studies should always relate this explicitly to the spatial extent of a city implied by the population- or area-based city definition used, as well as to the observed degree of spatial variation in the locational characteristic(s) of primary interest. Moreover, they should always show the sensitivity of their results to (sensible) changes in the cell size, shape, and/or orientation of the grid used to incorporate the necessary information on potential city locations.29\n4. Expanding empirical possibilities # Having laid out the basic empirical framework used to identify the important factors in city location, I now turn to the promises that recent advances in data availability hold for our (empirical) understanding of city origins.\n4.1. Better data # 4.1.1. Historical city location # The early data sets on historical city location mostly focussed on medieval and early-modern Europe and the Mediterranean. Recently, the spatial and temporal coverage of such data sets has greatly expanded. This is in no small part due to the ever better ability to digitize old maps, atlases, archives and other written data sources, harbouring a wealth of information on the location of cities and their characteristics. Increasingly researchers are exploiting advances in automatic hand-written text recognition, in the ability to (automatically) digitize features shown on old maps for use in GIS software (Combes et al., 2021), or even in the detection of (previously unknown) settlements using machine-learning techniques scanning through satellite data (see e.g., Orengo et al., 2020).\nImportantly, these developments make it increasingly possible to empirically identify the important determinants of city location in other parts of the world than Europe and the Mediterranean. Moreover, it might make it feasible to shed empirical light on the important, yet so far empirically unexplored, question why some early (small-scale) settlements developed into cities whereas others never grew beyond the size of a village, or even disappeared again (see Ploeckl (2021) for a first empirical pass at this question). Table 2 in the Appendix lists several notable examples of such data sets.\n4.1.2. The locational characteristics of (potential) city locations # At the same time, we have seen an explosion in the availability of spatially extremely detailed georeferenced datasets on an ever expanding array of a location\u0026rsquo;s geographical characteristics. It is the result of ever better, often satellite-based, methods to observe and analyze the earth\u0026rsquo;s soil characteristics, ecosystems, weather patterns, elevation, rivers, coastlines, land cover, agricultural suitability, mineral deposits, and prevalence of natural disasters.30 Most of these data sets document the geographical state of the world today, at most going back 10 or 20 years. In many cases this is not so much of a concern when studying cities\u0026rsquo; historical origins, since many geographical features are only changing extremely slowly over time. However, when studying the emergence of the earliest cities, hundreds (or even thousands) of years ago, the assumption that particular geographic features are time-invariant becomes more and more untenable.\nIncreasingly however, researchers are also developing geo-referenced data sets documenting what a location\u0026rsquo;s geographical characteristics looked like in the past. These are based on digitized historical atlases documenting historic land cover, the historic course of rivers and coastlines, or the location of historic mines and quarries (see e.g., the ORBIS or OXREP database, or the Ancient World Mapping Centre); or on the use of geospatial modelling techniques to infer locations\u0026rsquo; climatic conditions from point-based observations of tree rings, ice cores, soil deposits, or contemporaneous observations from ships\u0026rsquo; logbooks and other textual meteorological records. See www.historicalclimatology.com for useful links to many such (finished and still ongoing) efforts, or www.hgis.org.uk for useful links to many interesting historical GIS projects and data sets.\n4.2. Better data - expanding possibilities # These, much more detailed, data sets expand our ability to identify the most important city seeds in several important ways.\n4.2.1. More precisely specified locational characteristics # First of all, it allows us to consider a much wider range of, more precisely measured, locational characteristics. For example, we can now include detailed measures of a location\u0026rsquo;s soil suitability for cultivating a wide range of individual crops. We can further distinguish between different riverine locations based on features of the river that they are located on (its water flow, whether it is fordable, or how far one can sail up- or downstream). Or, instead of including simple measures of a location\u0026rsquo;s elevation above sea level or the ruggedness of the surrounding terrain, we can now precisely capture the elevation of a location vis-a-vis its nearby surroundings (e.g., location on a hilltop overlooking the surrounding area, or at the entry of a valley or mountain pass).\nThis much improved precision also holds for measures of a location\u0026rsquo;s distance to other cities, or to particular geographic features (e.g., a natural harbor, mineral deposit, or source of potable water). Most studies to date use the simple geodesic distance between locations (Bosker and Buringh, 2017; Barjamovic et al., 2019; Bakker et al., 2021). It is now increasingly (computationally) feasible, to calculate least cost, or fastest, routes between locations instead, based on detailed geographic information on the terrain and/or water bodies that one has to cross to travel from one location to another; possibly also depending on the transportation mode/technology used (see e.g., Faber (2014); Verhagen et al. (2019); Feyrer and Sacerdote (2009); Pascali (2017); Seror (2020), or ORBIS).\nFrom an identification perspective, the substantial increase in localized spatial variation in these more precisely measured geographic characteristics is an important virtue. It allows for the identification of their effect on city emergence based on this localized variation only (by e.g., including a spatially much more detailed set of fixed effects), hereby significantly reducing endogeneity concerns related to omitted variable bias.\n4.2.2. The differential importance of locational characteristics # Second, the much-improved data availability provides the researcher (many) more degrees of freedom. It makes it possible to move beyond estimating the simple average effect of a particular locational characteristic, and instead aim to identify how it possibly differentially affects city formation depending on a location\u0026rsquo;s other geographical characteristics, or characteristics of the period, or part of the world, under consideration.\nThe existing empirical papers on city emergence have made some attempts to do this, but they are mostly limited to allowing the effect of a particular locational characteristic to vary over time or across countries or continents.31 Although finding interesting patterns in the effect of particular locational characteristics,32 the exact reason(s) for, or mechanism(s) behind, these patterns are often not clearly pinpointed. The fast expanding scope and detail of the data sets discussed in sections 4.1.1 Historical city location, 4.1.2 The locational characteristics of (potential) city locations provide possibilities to do this more carefully, possibly even making use of novel data-driven methods to identify heterogenous treatment effects (Athey and Imbens, 2015).\n4.2.3. Data-driven or model-based inference # In fact, one could take this one step further and use such machine learning approaches to select those (combinations of) potential city seeds that best rationalize the observed spatial distribution of city location in the geographic area and time period under consideration. One could do this either in a purely data-driven way, collecting information on as many alleged city seeds as possible and running the prediction algorithm (see Düben and Krause (2020) for an example; or Athey and Imbens (2019) for a general discussion of machine learning methods). Alternatively, one could firmly base oneself in spatial economic theory and use the available data to calibrate a spatial economic model of city formation that is rich enough to allow one to fully exploit the richness of the available data, while at the same time capturing the important features of the economic and urban context in the geographic area and time period under consideration. In subsequent counterfactuals one can then assess the (relative) importance of individual locational characteristics for city emergence (see Nagy (2020) for an example). Arguably, such methods are especially interesting when lacking a convincing source of exogenous variation to identify the effect of the city seed(s) of interest.\n4.3. Better data - improved causal inference # Last, but certainly not least, the much improved scope and detail of the now available data sets on city development and its origins also widens the possibility to exploit exogenous changes in (the importance of) particular locational characteristics to identify their causal effect on city emergence. Using such ‘natural experiments’ as sources of exogenous variation has increasingly found its way into applied work in urban and regional economics, as well as in economic history (see Baum-Snow and Ferreira (2015) and Cantoni and Yuchtman (2020) for excellent overviews). The existing empirical papers on city emergence have not yet (explicitly) used such methods, instead relying on the inclusion of fixed effects and (many) other observed determinants of city development for the conditional independence assumption to hold. Future studies should aim to improve on this. Four different types of natural experiments are particularly interesting in the context of city emergence:\n4.3.1. Naturally occurring geographic or climatic shocks # Climate change, long-term changes in (the volatility of) rainfall patterns and/or temperature primarily affect a locations\u0026rsquo; agricultural potential. If profound enough, it may substantially change a location\u0026rsquo;s, or even an entire region\u0026rsquo;s, urban prospects (e.g. contributing to the demise of the Indus Valley Civilization or the Mayan cities in Mesoamerica). However, it typically evolves only slowly over time and only varies gradually across space. Exploiting the variation that it offers thus calls for data on city development, as well as the climatic variable(s) of interest, over a sufficiently long period of time and a sufficiently large geographic area. Moreover, a concern is that people start to adapt or mitigate its consequences, complicating the identification of its effects.\nNatural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, floods, pandemics, or crop diseases), do not so much face this latter concern. Even if a location is known to be vulnerable to particular disasters, their exact timing and scale is hard to predict, which is a clear plus from an identification perspective. However, exploiting the occurrence of natural disasters to identify the effect of particular geographical characteristics on a location\u0026rsquo;s urban chances comes with its own difficulties. They often affect multiple locational characteristics at the same time, and generate substantial spillover effects on locations not directly affected by the disaster as people move away from the affected area. Moreover, the occurrence of some natural disasters (e.g., erosion, soil depletion, or droughts) may depend nontrivially on a region\u0026rsquo;s (urban) population density raising possible endogeneity concerns.33\nFinally, a location\u0026rsquo;s direct access to the sea or a river is a noteworthy category that is, especially when considering longer time periods, subject to change as rivers silt up or change their course, and coastlines shift due to floods or sea level rises/drops. The availability of detailed geospatial information on changes in the historic course of rivers and coastlines offers interesting possibilities to quantify the importance of access to (navigable) water in determining city location (see e.g., Seror (2020) or Allen et al. (2020)).\n4.3.2. Technological change # Second, one can exploit the (unexpected) introduction of a new, or the redundancy of an old, technology, in combination with (exogenous) variation across space in the introduction, applicability and/or usefulness of the new technology.34 The introduction of new crops or agricultural technologies can e.g., differentially change locations’ potential to grow a sufficient surplus to sustain a thriving city, or, in the case of cash crops, their economic potential in general and hereby their ability to attract permanent settlers. Also, the introduction of new storage and food preservation techniques made it possible for cities to emerge in places that, given their own agricultural potential, were no viable city site before.35\nSimilarly, the discovery of a new mineral deposit, or of new, economically viable, ways to extract them, the depletion of a mineral deposit, as well as changes in a mineral\u0026rsquo;s (un)importance due to technological advances in other areas, can have profound effects on locations\u0026rsquo; urban chances by changing the incentive to cluster near the mineral deposit.\nAnd last, but certainly not least, changes in transportation technology have not only made it possible to transport ever more goods, in easier and cheaper ways, hereby diminishing the importance of a fertile agriculture hinterland for city development. Often, different geographical characteristics are important in the construction of different types of transportation infrastructure, introducing interesting variation across space and time in the likelihood that a location is well-served by a particular transportation technology36\n4.3.3. Planned cities # Third, the top down planning of new city locations (see section 2.4) offers interesting possibilities to identify the importance of particular city seeds. Notably, we can exploit the construction of these planned cities to identify how they, or the novel roads and railways connecting them to the outside world, affect the urban chances of other (nearby) locations. These other locations, as well as their characteristics, are very often not given much weight by the policy makers planning the site(s) of the new city(ies). As such, one can view the construction of the planned cities as an exogenous, differential, shock to one (or more) of these other locations\u0026rsquo; characteristics that can be used to identify their importance for locations’ urban chances. If available, one could even exploit details of the political decision process selecting the new city locations, or the fact that some cities were planned but never built, in the construction of a plausible (set of) control location(s).37\n4.3.4. Military destruction # And, in a very similar vein, the destruction of cities, the agricultural/economic potential of their hinterland, or the infrastructure connecting them to the outside world, can also provide useful quasi-experimental variation. Notably, one could exploit the fact that locations closer to the now-destroyed city, or the now-destroyed infrastructure links, suffer bigger losses in market access. In doing so, one can think of levying information on the military constraints, or objectives, determining why some places suffered more destruction than others, or by focussing on locations that, by unfortunate coincidence, happened to be located along the (planned) routes taken by an army on its way to the city or cities targeted by the military campaign.38\n5. Conclusion # The debate on the (most) important locational characteristics explaining the origins of cities did, until recently, take place without solid empirical evidence assessing the many (theoretical) claims by urban historians, location theorists, regional scientists or urban economists. This has started to changed in recent years. The availability of ever better, spatially more finegrained, data on the historical and geographical characteristics of cities, as well as of locations that never developed into a city, in combination with more advanced empirical and computational methods will almost surely see a better, empirically well-grounded, understanding of the relative importance of the alleged different drivers of city location in different parts of the world and at different points in history. Although, undoubtedly, there will certainly always remain some room for myths in the error term.\nAuthor statement # Bosker: conceptualization, methodology, writing.\nDeclaration of competing interest # None.\nA.

Oudlaan 50, 3062 PA, Rotterdam, the Netherlands E-mail address: bosker@ese.eur.nl.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nSee also Ullman (1941), Lampard (1955), Sjoberg (1965), or Cowgill (2004) for excellent overviews.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThis section summarizes insights from a vast body of literature in urban history and archeology. Instead of filling it with references, I refer the reader to the important contributions mentioned in the first paragraph of this paper\u0026rsquo;s introductory section (see also footnote 1).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nIt is therefore no coincidence that the earliest cities are found in four of the world\u0026rsquo;s most fertile riverine landscapes: Mesopotamia, and the Nile, Indus and Yellow river valleys. Or, in case of the earliest cities in Mesoamerica and the Andes, in places with fertile soil and regular, and sufficient rainfall that could be easily stored and harnessed for drinking and agricultural purposes.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nTrees also do not grow very well in tundra and desert environments as well as above the timberline, but many other characteristics of these places also make them very unattractive as potential city locations.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nParadoxically, the trade-related advantages of being an easily accessible location can easily turn against a location in times of war, increasing the likelihood of marauding armies finding their way to the city. For example, settlements founded on the shores of the Mediterranean moved inland and/or uphill in response to the threat posed by Arab raiders during the late Medieval period. And, the Mongols used the exact same routes through the deserts and steppes of Central Asia and the Middle East as the trading caravans, wreaking havoc on the cities that they found in their path.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThese models formalize the important role for trade (costs) in city formation and/or persistence. They in fact provide a formal foundation for the regularly spaced grid-type structure of the urban systems stressed by the early location theorists. Their theoretical predictions have even been successful in helping to idenfity the location of lost settlements (Barjamovic et al., 2019).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe existing city may even put strong restrictions on, or use its military power to prevent, any new city development in its immediate backyard (e.g., the German ‘Bannmeile’ or French ‘banlieue’).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nBosker and Buringh (2017) find strong support for this non-linear effect of distance to already existing cities on locations\u0026rsquo; urban chances.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nNotable examples are China\u0026rsquo;s imperial administrative cities (Trewartha, 1952), Abuja (Nigeria), Amarna (Egypt), Baghdad (Iraq), Ayutthaya (Thailand), Baghdad (Iraq), Brasilia (Brazil), Canberra (Australia), Islamabad (Pakistan), Naypyidaw (Myanmar), Nouakchott (Mauritania), Quezon City (Philippines), Saint Petersburg (Russia), Sejong (South Korea), Washington D.C. (USA), Yamoussoukro (Cote d’Ivoire), and recently Indonesia unveiled plans to move its capital from Jakarta to East Kalimantan.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nNotable examples are: Alamein New City (Egypt), Cyberjaya (Malyasia), Yachay Knowledge City (Ecuador), Konza Technology City (Kenya), Songdo (South Korea), Mohammed VI Green City (Marocco), Masdar City (Abu Dhabi), NEOM (Saudi Arabia), or Gujarat International Finance City (India).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nOr to separately identify the effect of a time-varying variable for each period that the data is available.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nUnless of course one can credibly argue that the locational characteristic of interest is not correlated with any unobserved locational characteristic related to a location ever developing into a city.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nNote that equation (1) also easily accommodates a fixed effects setup. In that case Xi and/or Xj(i)t would each simply be a full set of dummy variables: one for each potential city location in case of Xi, and one for each broader defined geographical unit in each time period in case of Xj(i)t.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nFor example, in China an urban settlement was only considered a city if it had city walls, whereas in Egypt and Mesoamerica we do not have evidence of cities having walls. And, in Europe, many towns obtained so-called city rights, but the granting of such rights was often politicised by the ruling elites and not necessarily based on clear well-defined criteria for what it took for a settlement or town to be a city.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nPopulation sizes of the earliest cities are often based on considering the area that these cities covered, multiplied by an (assumed) number of people per km2 based on evidence on the average number of dwellings per km2 and the average number of people per dwelling. This explains why population density is not - or implicitly - used as a criterion by any of these studies.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nExceptions are studies that face the absence of information on the population size or area of the settlements that they study (see e.g. Michaels and Rauch (2018) or Bakker et al. (2021)). These either resort to using the settlement-town-city classification used by the (historical) atlas that they use to locate cities, or they simply take any evidence off (urban) development as an indication of (urban) development.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nA forthcoming issue of the Journal of Urban Economics focusses on the modern-day equivalent of this problem: the proper delineation of the spatial extent of cities using (a combination of) very detailed day- or nighttime satellite-imagery, cadastral records, and/or commuting patterns.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nBosker and Buringh (2017) draw a random sample of coordinate pairs with coordinates rounded up to 3 digits behind the comma. This sets an implicit minimum distance between sample locations of about 100m. It can thus be considered as (approximately) randomly sampling from an exhaustive grid of 100 m × 100 m grid cells, taking the midpoint of each cell as representative of the entire cell.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nShould we e.g. classify a grid cell as urban when it is home to at least one city of a certain size? Or, should we instead consider the total number of cities, or the total urban population in the grid cell? Similarly, should we classify a grid cell as riverine as soon as a river runs through it, or use its river density instead? And, should we calculate a grid cell\u0026rsquo;s distance to a port, capital or nearest other city starting from its midpoint, its largest settlement, or from the grid cell\u0026rsquo;s boundary?.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe effect of a locational characteristic that varies only gradually over space (e.g., rainfall, temperature), is very hard to identify using the localized variation in city development itself, limiting the advantages of using a very finegrained grid.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nUsing the generally accepted average density for (historical) cities of 100 people per hectare, and assuming that the city is of circular shape, the often-used population cutoffs to define a city of 5000 or 10,000 inhabitants imply a city that extends about 400m or 560m to all sides.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nTaking a random sample of grid cells can be a solution for some of these issues, provided that it is large enough so that a sufficient number of the drawn potential city locations actually do develop into a city during the period under study, ensuring sufficient power to test the hypotheses of interest.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nSee Briant et al.

Developing and maintaining emotional brand attachment and brand involvement with consumers have become a strategic marketing endeavor of luxury brands. A significant question bearing both theoretical and practical implications, however, is whether emotional brand attachment or brand involvement is more apposite to warrant a luxury brand’s performance and to safeguard the original brand from counterfeits, which remains unanswered. To address this knowledge gap, a survey was conducted. On the basis of an empirical study, this paper reveals that emotional brand attachment is a more prominent influencer than brand involvement to escalate original brand patronage although the effect of brand involvement is also significant. However, while improved brand involvement pushes consumers to patronize counterfeits, higher emotional brand attachment does not result in increased counterfeit patronage. These effects do not vary as a function of previous experience of either originals or counterfeits. Findings of this research contribute to brand literature by presenting empirical evidence of distinct influence of emotional brand attachment over brand involvement, which represents significant practical implications in relation to strategic brand management and anti-counterfeiting strategies.\nKeywords Emotional brand attachment · Brand involvement · Past experience · Original luxury brands · Counterfeits · Consumer patronage\nIntroduction # Emotional brand attachment research has gained momentum in recent years. Research findings demonstrate that brand attachment leads to consumption behavior and a higher level of consumer loyalty, which provides a guarantee of sustainable financial performance (Park et al. 2010). Research also reports the feelings that a brand generates, which have the potential to differentiate one brand from another and consumers are usually emotionally attached to only a limited number of brands (Park et al. 2010). In practice, building emotional brand attachment with consumers has also increasingly become a strategic marketing endeavor of businesses, particularly in luxury brands (Cailleux et al. 2009; Theng et al. 2013). In contrast, brand involvement, a long-established concept, is also proven to have a significant effect on consumer decision-making and brand commitment (Mittal and Lee 1989). Developing and enhancing emotional brand attachment and brand involvement are both common strategies adopted by practitioners to improve performance. While the research findings support these marketing strategies, a critical question bearing significant theoretical and practical value remains unanswered: is emotional brand attachment more pertinent in determination of luxury brands’ performance than brand involvement? Moreover, there is unprecedented upsurge of demand for counterfeits (OECD 2017) and in reality that luxury brands, the most affected by counterfeits (Wilcox et al. 2009), are fighting a losing battle despite the fact that they are increasingly investing in anti-counterfeiting (Bian 2018). Thus, when and how emotional brand attachment or brand involvement may be effective in eliminating demand for counterfeit luxury brands requires research attention.\nCounterfeits have become a serious global problem in the last couple of decades, partially attributed to luxury brands that have been making branded products widely accessible and affordable via mass production. An estimation from the International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition suggests that the value of global trade in counterfeiting and piracy in 2015 is US$1.77 trillion (International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition 2011). Among the affected, luxury brands alone lose a staggering US$600 billion or more in 2014 (International Chamber of Commerce 2011). Counterfeits are a serious competitor and threat to original luxury branded products (originals hereafter).\nThe impact of counterfeits on originals include (but are not limited to): a reduction in consumers’ confidence in legitimate brands, damage of brand equity and companies’ reputations, loss of revenue, and increased costs associated with trying to contain infringement (Bian 2018). Businesses are teaming up with national and international governments to combat counterfeits. Nevertheless, counterfeits are more accessible than ever before. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that the global value of trade in counterfeit and pirated goods reached to US$461 billion in 2013, which is more than over an 80 percent increase since 2008 (OECD 2016). According to an OECD (2019) report the figure mounted US$509 billion in 2016 and may reach US$4.2 trillion by 2022. In the meantime, loss to luxury brands exceeded US$600 billion to counterfeits in 2014 (Wu et al. 2019) compared to US$12 billion reported in 2011 (International Chamber of Commerce 2011). Consumer demand for counterfeits, particularly in the luxury goods market, is one of the leading causes of the apparent growth of the counterfeiting phenomenon (Antonopoulos et al. 2017; Phau and Teah 2009; Bian and Veloutsou 2007; Gentry et al. 2001; Nia and Zaichkowsky 2000). When and what can be done to eliminate consumer demand for counterfeits, while in the meantime not causing damage to originals, is at the top of the brand protection agenda of many businesses (Evans et al. 2019; Wilson et al. 2016; Wilson 2017).\nTo address these issues, the objectives of this research are twofold: (1) to understand the theoretical implications and the relative impact of emotional brand attachment versus brand involvement on consumer original patronage as opposed to counterfeit patronage; and (2) to gain insights into whether the effect of emotional brand attachment versus brand involvement varies across consumers of different characteristics, namely original experience and counterfeit experience.\nPrevious research has demonstrated that emotional brand attachment better predicts brand loyalty and price sensitivity than attitude valance (Thomson et al. 2005). Park et al. (2010) have revealed that brand attachment and attitude strength have distinct effects and the former is a better indicator of consumer behavior. In the meantime, brand involvement, a construct of a rich research history, is also commonly accepted as a key antecedent to brand loyalty and performance. A more convincing case for the determinant power of emotional brand attachment thus can be made if its influence were significantly different to that of brand involvement. This research examines which is best to establish, emotional brand attachment or brand involvement, in order to enhance the performance of originals and simultaneously to manage consumer patronage of counterfeits. Findings in this area will bring substantial contribution to the emotional brand attachment literature and strategic brand management. According to the systematic review we conducted, a comprehensive understanding of the comparative advantages in relation to creating strong emotional brand attachments rather than increasing brand involvement among consumers of different characteristics is scarce; the second research objective is especially relevant and important for marketing practitioners in providing guidance on which strategy to use in a particular situation.\nTo this end, the novelties of this research include: (1) first of a kind to propose and analyze the competitive advantages concerning developing emotional brand attachment versus brand involvement in relation to originals; (2) one of the few to unveil possible outcomes associated with two commonly adopted but distinct branding strategies, namely improving brand involvement and establishing emotional brand attachment, in addressing consumer demand for counterfeits. The findings of this research, therefore, advances Kaufmann et al. (2016) who revealed the desirable effect of emotional brand attachment on elimination of demand for counterfeits; (3) while extant research has examined the direct effect of availability and past experience on demand for both originals and counterfeits (e.g., Yoo and Lee 2012), this research investigates impact of past experience of counterfeits and originals as a boundary condition on consumer patronage.\nThis paper first presents an overview of relevant literature and hypotheses tested. The literature review mainly covers emotional brand attachment, brand involvement, and counterfeit-related research, followed by an outline of the research methods employed to address the research objectives. The research results are subsequently presented. This paper concludes with a discussion of the key findings, the theoretical and practical implications, and suggestions for future research.\nLiterature and hypotheses # Emotional brand attachment # In psychology, attachment is an emotion-laden target-specific bond between an individual and a specific object (Bowlby 1979). Desire to develop strong emotional attachment with particular others serves basic human needs, such as social and esteem desires (Bowlby 1980; Ainsworth et al. 1978). In a marketing context, consumers are also inclined to build and maintain emotionally charged associations with brands (Belk 1988; Schouten and McAlexander 1995; Fournier 1998). Emotional brand attachment, introduced by Thomson et al. (2005), reflects the bond between a consumer and a specific brand and involves feelings toward the brand (Shimul et al. 2019; Fastoso and González-Jiménez 2018). Emotional brand attachments are positively associated with feelings of unique dimensions, namely connection, affection and passion (Thomson et al. 2005).\nSimilar to the attachment concept in psychology, emotional brand attachment varies in strength and has prominent influence on consumer behavior. Thomson et al. (2005) have reported that the more strongly consumers are emotionally attached to a brand, the more likely they are to be loyal to the brand and willing to pay a price premium. In the same vein, Park et al. (2010) have demonstrated that brand attachment is a significant predictor of behaviors. Specifically, the more strongly consumers are attached to a brand, the more willing they are to engage in challenging behaviors, such as those requiring investment of time, money, energy, and reputation. Therefore, it is rational to posit that in a market where counterfeits are openly accessible, the more strongly the emotional bond consumers perceive toward an original luxury brand, the more likely they will purchase the original.\nHow would emotional brand attachment affect consumers’ patronage of counterfeits? Limited research has been done to address this both theoretically and practically important question with one exception of Kaufmann et al. (2016), which reports that emotional brand attachment has a negative effect on the purchase intention of counterfeit handbags. In line with this finding, this paper posits that the influence of emotional brand attachment on counterfeit patronage is likely to be negative. Counterfeits are illegal products that use the trademark of the originals but are made without the permission of the trademark holder (Chaudhry and Walsh 1996). These illegally produced products are invaders and competitors and cause misfortune to the originals (Marticotte and Arcand 2017), which subsequently induce threats to consumers who are emotionally bonded to the original brand. Attachment theory suggests that individuals who are strongly attached to a person or object possess two unique characteristics: they display specific behaviors such as proximity maintenance and separation distress (Bowlby 1979) and they are committed to preserving their relationship with the person or object (Johnson and Rusbult 1989; Miller 1997). This is because a strong emotional attachment is characterized by a perception that the object is irreplaceable. From a brand perspective, consumers of a high level of emotional brand attachment tend to incorporate a brand as part of their self and hold salient feelings about the brand and are more willing to forego personal resources to maintain a relationship with the brand (Park et al. 2010). Therefore, the stronger the emotional brand attachment is the more likely consumers will defend the brand against other alternatives available in the market, including counterfeits. Based on these considerations, consumers of a high level of emotional brand attachment are more likely to disapprove of counterfeits. This research, thus, proposes:\nH1 Emotional brand attachment has a positive effect on consumer original patronage.\nH2 Emotional brand attachment has a negative effect on consumer counterfeit patronage.\nBrand involvement # Involvement is “a person’s perceived relevance of the object based on inherent needs, values and interests” (Zaichkowsky 1985, 342) and is a mental state that influences the allocation of cognitive resources to evaluation of an object, decision, or action (Mittal and Lee 1989). Product involvement is the most researched construct and it has been established that the level of involvement determines the depth, complexity and extent of cognitive and behavioral processes during the consumer choice process (Kokkinaki 1999; Chakravarti and Janiszewski 2003; Kleiser and Wagner 1999; Kapferer and Laurent 1985; Rothschild and Houston 1980; Feng et al. 2019; Friedmann and Lowengart 2019; Stewart et al. 2019; Alonso-Dos-Santos et al. 2019). Therefore, product involvement is a central framework, vital to understand consumer decision-making (Chakravarti and Janiszewski 2003; Fill 2005) and is an important contingency variable for the success of marketing strategies (MacInnis and Park 1991; Petty and Cacioppo 1986). Previous researchers (Kirmani et al. 1999; Bloch 1982; Bloch and Richins 1983; Zaichkowsky 1985, 1986; Mittal and Lee 1988) have distinguished product involvement from brand involvement and has long established that product involvement and brand involvement are distinct constructs (e.g., Bloch and Richins (1983). Surprisingly, brand involvement, the consumer’s degree of interest or arousal for a given brand, has not received much research attention in the counterfeit context. Bian and Moutinho (2011) and Bian (2006) have studied the effects of product involvement on consumer decision-making and purchase tendency of counterfeits and originals. Neither of these articles, however, explores the possible influence of brand involvement on consumer behavioral strategies toward originals versus counterfeits, which leaves a knowledge void of substantial importance.\nInvolvement is fundamental to the Elaboration Likelihood Model (Petty and Cacioppo 1986) which posits that high involvement tends to engender a central route to persuasion, in which consumers exert the cognitive effort to evaluate the issue when relevant objects or arguments are presented to them. Consumers with high involvement will be more motivated to invest time and the cognitive effort required for self-verification. In contrast, a low level of involvement would create low consumer motivation to process information, which leads to a greater possibility of the peripheral route of persuasion. When involvement is low, consumers care less about personal, experiential, and symbolic gain than when involvement is high (Solomon et al. 1985).\nThe premise of this paper is that the principles of the seminal Elaboration Likelihood Model (Petty and Cacioppo 1986) are also applicable to brand involvement. Therefore, it is rational to posit that brand involvement is likely to have a positive effect on consumer patronage of originals because higher brand involvement will drive consumers to go through more deliberative decision-making which will enable them to be more appreciative to not only functional benefits but also hedonic gains from originals. This is due to the original version of branded products being commonly recognized as superior in their values (signal, hedonic, and functional). In contrast, brand involvement will negatively affect consumer patronage of counterfeits, because the lower the brand involvement, the more likely consumers will make quick decisions, which require little to limited effort. Hence, counterfeits are more likely to be acted upon in the low brand involvement situation because consumers are less attentive to the core attributes of a brand, such as high quality (Cheah et al. 2015), instead they tend to purchase impulsively and would be responsive to brand names. In other words, the prominent brand name and logo copied by counterfeits may serve as the peripheral cues of persuasion. In addition, the low-price tag, a key feature, of counterfeits (Eisend et al. 2017; Eisend and Schuchert-Güler 2006) is also likely to serve as another key peripheral cue which lure consumers to counterfeits when brand involvement is low. Based on the above reasoning, this research proposes the following:\nH3 Brand involvement has a positive effect on consumer original patronage.\nH4 Brand involvement has a negative effect on consumer counterfeit patronage.\nComparative effect of emotional brand attachment and brand involvement # If H1–H2 and H3–H4 hold and emotional brand attachment and brand involvement have positive effects on consumer original patronage but negative influences on counterfeit patronage, the next viable questions are:\nIs any one of the two determinants more influential than the other? Which one is more statistically effective in enhancing/eliminating demand for originals/counterfeits? Brand involvement is conceptually distinguished from emotional brand attachment. Involvement is a state of mental readiness that influences the allocation of cognitive resources (Park and Mittal 1985). The concept of involvement arguably represents consumers’ perceptual and conceptual responses, which mainly tap the realm of cognition (Zaichkowsky 1985). Emotional attachment, however, goes beyond mental readiness and resource allocation. Emotional brand attachments are consumers’ affective reactions toward a brand and, thus, are clearly relevant to the realm of emotions (Thomson et al. 2005). While involvement represents a manifestation of one’s volitional control (Bowlby 1980; Hazan and Zeifman 1999), emotional brand attachment is a reflection of one’s affections.\nEmotional attachment is inherently related to the consumers’ self-concept (Park et al. 2010, Kleine et al. 1993). The more attached consumers are to a brand, the more likely they would view the brand as part of themselves and have salient feelings about the brand. As a result, they are more likely to be willing to maintain proximity to the brand even at a higher cost than they normally retain. The effects of brand involvement on consumer behavior should be relatively weaker than emotional brand attachment. This is because brand involvement, although a self-centered construct (Laaksonen 1994), is not directly connected to consumer’ self-concept, which consumers usually protect at all cost. Thus, emotional brand attachment (compared to brand involvement) should show stronger influence on the tendency of maintaining a brand relationship, manifested through patronage of originals. The same reasoning is likely to be applicable to counterfeits. This research, thus, anticipates the following:\nH5 Emotional brand attachment has a stronger effect on consumer original patronage than brand involvement.\nH6 Emotional brand attachment has a stronger effect on consumer counterfeit patronage than brand involvement.\nModerating effects # It is important to note that the hypothesized effects in H1 through H4 may not be equally pronounced for all consumers. This research predicts that these effects might be stronger for consumers with certain predispositions. Specifically, this research is interested in the possible moderating effect of original experience and counterfeit experience on the relationships between emotional brand attachment/brand involvement and original/counterfeit patronage.\nAs outlined in the context of H1 to H4, emotional brand attachment (brand involvement) increases (decreases) original (counterfeit) patronage because the more attached (interested) consumers are to a brand the more likely they would be committed to the original brand. Manifestations of a higher level of commitment range from higher brand loyalty and willingness to make financial sacrifices to deny other competing brands (Park et al. 2010) including counterfeits. However, this effect might vary between consumers of low and high original/counterfeit experience. While previous research has investigated the direct effect of past experience on both originals and counterfeits, for example Yoo and Lee (2012), how consumer patronage might vary as a function of past experience remains largely unknown. This is particularly the case in relation to counterfeits.\nProduct experience has important implications for consumer information processing and behavior. According to Hill and Alexander (2006), a consumer’s purchase behavior of a product is determined by the level of their experience of the product. Similarly, Lianto (2015) has demonstrated that past experience affects consumer purchase intention of a product. As long as circumstances remain stable, experience has a stronger influence on behavior than cognitive consideration (Bamberg et al. 2003; Hill and Alexander 2006; Yoo and Lee 2009) and perceived behavioral control (Bagozzi 1981; Ouellette and Wood 1998; Yoo and Lee 2009, 2012). In addition, habitual behavior literature suggests that experience is one of the key antecedences of a habit (Schneider and Shiffrin 1977). Repeated experience will result in habitual behavior, which people are able to perform with little burden (Schneider and Shiffrin 1977; Lianto 2015). Past experience generates an inertial habit with repeated behavior and predicts future behavior better than cognitive evaluations of alternatives do (Bamberg et al. 2003). Seetharaman et al. (1999) has confirmed that inertial choice behavior formed by past experience makes consumers repeat the same purchase patterns and is less sensitive to marketing programs developed to change such decision-making.\nAccording to the empirical findings of product experience and habitual behavior literature, consumers with a high level of original experience (compared with consumers with a low level of original experience) are likely to demonstrate different reactions to originals/counterfeits. In addition, these consumers would be more familiar with the superiorities (e.g., benefits and advantages) associated with the originals, which might subsequently further enhance the effects of both emotional brand attachment and brand involvement on original/counterfeit patronage. For consumers with a low level of original experience, benefits associated with the originals might be more distant and abstract, thus appearing to be less distinct, which would subsequently mitigate the influence of emotional brand attachment and brand involvement. The current research, thus, proposes:\nH7a Past original experience strengthens the relationship between emotional brand attachment and original patronage.\nH7b Past original experience strengthens the relationship between emotional brand attachment and counterfeit patronage.\nH7c Past original experience strengthens the relationship between brand involvement and original patronage.\nH7d Past original experience strengthens the relationship between brand involvement and counterfeit patronage.\nWill counterfeit experience influence consumer patronage of originals as well as counterfeits? Consumers with a high level of counterfeit experience might be more appreciative to relative benefits associated with counterfeits. Previous research findings suggest that consumers with counterfeit experience have a more positive attitude toward counterfeits than consumers who have little experience (Nia and Zaichkowsky 2000). Counterfeit evaluations of experienced consumers are more positive than less experienced consumers (Penz and Stöttinger 2008; Moon et al. 2018). Yoo and Lee (2009) have also presented empirical evidence that past experience of counterfeits and original branded products have a positive influence on purchase intention of counterfeits and originals. The possible explanation is that consumers with more experience of counterfeits are inclined to believe that the functionalities of counterfeits are close to originals (Bian et al. 2016); thus, they attribute “value for money” to counterfeits (de Matos et al. 2007). These perceived benefits of counterfeits evolved from past experience are likely to mitigate the impacts of emotional brand attachment and brand involvement on consumer product patronage, originals and counterfeits. In other words, the effect of emotional brand attachment (brand involvement) on original and counterfeit patronage will both be reduced. Based on this reasoning this research predicts a moderation effect of counterfeit experience on the relationship between emotional brand attachment (brand involvement) and counterfeit (original) patronage. The proposed relationships are:\nH8a Past counterfeit experience weakens the relationship between emotional brand attachment and original patronage.\nH8b Past counterfeit experience weakens the relationship between emotional brand attachment and counterfeit patronage.\nH8c Past counterfeit experience weakens the relationship between brand involvement and original patronage.\nH8d Past counterfeit experience weakens the relationship between brand involvement and counterfeit patronage.\nFigure 1 presents the conceptual framework of this research. Both emotional brand attachment and brand involvement affect consumer’s original as well as counterfeit patronage. However, the influence of these determinants may vary, depending on the consumers’ level of previous engagement with originals and counterfeits, specifically past experience. This research also analyzes comparative effect of emotional brand attachment versus brand involvement.\nFig. 1 figure1\nFig. 1. Proposed framework linking emotional brand attachment, brand involvement, consumer original and counterfeit patronage\nFull size image\nMethod # Data collection and sample # To test the hypotheses data were collected using a paper and pencil survey method from Chinese consumers in shopping malls of China which are known for selling counterfeits openly. The choice of China, Beijing specifically, as the research context is because China is one of the largest markets for luxury brands (Cheung and Prendergast 2006) and is also the largest consumer market of counterfeits in the world (OECD and EUIPO 2019). On one hand, consumers crave original luxury brands and are happy to pay a premium price for originals (Vigneron and Johnson 2004), and on the other hand, counterfeits are also commonly acceptable to Chinese consumers (Cheung and Prendergast 2006). About a decade ago, Swike et al. (2008) have reported that approximately twenty percent of domestic sales in China are counterfeits. The situation has very likely worsened in recent years in light of the increased accessibility of counterfeits. In fact, counterfeits have dedicated shopping areas in many major cities (Lin 2011), such as the Yanghuo Market in Tianjin and Silk Market in Beijing.\nTwo hundred and sixty-six Chinese consumers were invited to take part in this research. All collected questionnaires were useable. Respondents consisted of consumers aged between 19 and 54 (43.6% females, 56.4% males). The education attainment of respondents ranged between primary school and postgraduate degree. The sample (see “Appendix 1” for respondents’ profile) included consumers of low household income (less than RMB¥10,000 per month) to high household income (above RMB¥200,000 per month).\nBefore the respondents started filling out the questionnaires, they were informed that a large percentage of consumers knowingly purchase counterfeits, including consumers in developed countries, such as the UK and the USA. This measure, adopted by a number of previous studies where China was the research context (e.g., Veloutsou and Bian 2008; Wilhelmy et al. 2016; Bian et al. 2016), was used mainly to eliminate impression management tendency and to safeguard quality of data. This is because the technique is deemed to induce a respondent’s admission of potentially embarrassing behavior (Churchill and Iacobucci 1999). Additionally, respondents were assured that the information they provided would be kept strictly confidential and for academic research purposes only. As with Bian (2006) and Bian and Moutinho (2011), the definition of counterfeit was presented at the very beginning of the questionnaire to reduce confusion and more importantly to ensure data reliability. This research is particularly interested in original luxury brand versus counterfeit luxury brand-related consumer behavior. To capture relevant data, participants were referred to examples of high-end luxury brands, such as, Louis Vuitton and Hermes. All the referred luxury brands are widely available and heavily counterfeited. The questionnaire took less than 20 minutes to complete.\nMeasures # Emotional brand attachment was assessed using six items adapted from measures previously used in consumer research from Malär et al. (2011). These items are highly correlated (Cronbach α = .89) and capture three main dimensions of emotional bond with brands, namely affection, connection, and passion (Thomson et al. 2005). The brand involvement variable was measured with two items (r = .81) adapted from Trijp et al. (1996). This measure is appropriate because it was developed based on the involvement definition which falls within the domain of cognitive approaches by defining involvement (Laaksonen 1994). The moderating variables (original experience and counterfeit experience) were both measured using a semantic differential scale (seven-point, ranging from never to regular) adapted from Darmon and Laroche (1991). Whenever appropriate, multiple items were averaged to arrive at a single value for each variable. These average values are input indicators.\nThe dependent variables of counterfeit patronage (r = .89) and original patronage (r = .86) were measured using two items adopted from Zhao et al. (2013) and Grewal et al. (1998). Unless noted otherwise, all multi-item scales were assessed using a seven-point Likert format (strongly disagree to strongly agree). Personal information about respondents’ gender, monthly household income, age, and highest education attainment was also collected at the end of the research instrument. In general, the measurements show sufficient reliability. Table 1 reports the correlations of the conceptual framework variables. “Appendix 2” provides a list of the measures and their psychometric properties.\nTable 1 Correlations of framework variables\n1 2 3 4 5 1.Emotional brand attachment 2.Brand involvement .48** 3.Original patronage .51** .38** 4.Counterfeit patronage .11 .17** −.009 5.Original experience .22** .04 .29** −.17** 6.Counterfeit experience .01 .06 −.14* .34** −.18** * p ≤.05\n** p ≤ .01\nFull size table\nResults # Basic model # AMOS 25 path analysis was used to model the relationships proposed by the conceptual framework (see Fig. 1). Emotional brand attachment and brand involvement were allowed to correlate in the path model. For the basic model (presented using solid lines), the measures of overall fit generally meet conventional standards, which suggests that the model fits the data well (χ2/df = 2.880, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = .084, standardized root mean square residual [SRMR] = .027, normal fit index [NFI] = .983, and comparative fit index [CFI] = .989).\nThe parameter estimates of the basic model are reported in Table 2. The results suggest a significant positive relationship between emotional brand attachment and consumer original patronage (ϒ = .426, p \u0026lt; .01), which supports H1. The results provide no support for a negative relationship between emotional brand attachment and consumer counterfeit patronage (ϒ = .035, p \u0026gt; .10), which rejects H2. Brand involvement has a significant positive effect on original patronage (ϒ = .176, p \u0026lt; .01). H3 is supported. The results suggest a significant relationship between brand involvement and consumer counterfeit patronage (ϒ = .156, p \u0026lt; .05). Surprisingly, the effect is positive rather than negative as predicted, which rejects H4.\nTable 2 Results of hypotheses testing\nEmotional brand attachment → original patronage Brand involvement → original patron age Emotional brand attachment → counterfeit patronage Brand involvement → counterfeit patronage Standardized ∆x2 Standardized ∆x2 Standardized ∆x2 Standardized ∆x2 Estimate (t value) Estimate (t value) Estimate (t value) Estimate (t value) Basic model .426**(7.192) .176** (2.973) .035 (.513) .156* (2.254) Moderated models Experience of originals Low .332**(3.456) 2.715 .143(1.488) 2.238 .039(.705) 2.176 .187+(1.814) 2.077 High .441**(6.054) .212**(2.801) .075(.813) .131(1.408) Experience of counterfeits Low .448**(6.306) .861 .238**(3.349) 1.912 .067(.773) .925 .134(1.547) 1.064 High .394**(3.770) .086(.826) .027(.233) .195+(1.709) ** p ≤ .01\n* p ≤.05\n+ p ≤.10\nFull size table\nThe values of these two path coefficients provide support for the propositions regarding the relative impact of emotional brand attachment and brand involvement on original patronage as well as counterfeit patronage. For original patronage, emotional brand attachment has a stronger impact on original patronage than brand involvement. For counterfeit patronage, brand involvement effect, however, is more evident than emotional brand attachment. The corresponding differences are .250 (original patronage) and .121 (counterfeit patronage).\nIn order to test the H5 that the emotional brand attachment (ϒ = .426) and brand involvement (ϒ = .176) standardized beta weights were statistically different from each other, their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were estimated via bias corrected bootstrap (1000 re-samples). In the event that the confidence intervals overlapped by less than 50% the weights would be considered significantly different (p \u0026lt; .05) from each other (Cumming 2009). Half of the average of the overlapping confidence intervals was calculated (− .0045) and added to the lower bound estimate of the emotional brand attachment beta weight (.310) which yielded .3055. As the brand involvement upper bound estimate of .290 is lower than the value of .3055, in the original context, the difference between the emotional brand attachment and brand involvement standardized beta weights (∆ϒ = .25) is considered significantly larger than the brand involvement beta weight (p \u0026lt; .05). Thus, emotional brand attachment has a stronger effect on consumer original patronage than brand involvement, which supports H5.\nSimilarly, to test the H6 that the brand involvement (ϒ = .156) and emotional brand attachment (ϒ = .035) standardized beta weights were statistically different from each other, their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were estimated via bias corrected bootstrap (1000 re-samples). Half of the average of the overlapping confidence intervals was calculated (− .010) and added to the lower bound estimate of the brand involvement beta weight (.029) which yielded .019. As the emotional brand attachment upper bound estimate of .172 is higher than the value of .019, in the counterfeit context, the difference between the brand involvement and emotional brand attachment standardized beta weights (∆ϒ = .121) is not considered statistically significantly larger than the emotional brand attachment beta weight (p \u0026gt; .05). Therefore, the result suggests that emotional brand attachment does not have a stronger effect on consumer counterfeit patronage than brand involvement, which rejects H6.\nModerating model: original experience as moderator # Multiple group modeling was used to test H7 and H8, which refer to the moderating role of original experience and counterfeit experience. The median of the moderator values was used to split consumers into either low levels or high levels of original experience. AMOS 25 was used to test the moderated model suggested in the conceptual framework simultaneously in both subsamples. Table 2 presents the parameter estimates for the different subgroups.\nRegarding the first moderator, original experience, the measures of overall fit of the moderated model mostly meet conventional standards, which suggests that the model fits the data well (χ2/df = 2.048, RMSEA = .010, SRMR = .022, NFI = .988, and CFI = 1.000). As with consumer original patronage, the results confirm a positive moderating effect of original experience on the relationship between emotional brand engagement and original patronage. Although emotional brand attachment has a significant and positive effect on original patronage among consumers with a low level of original experience (ϒ = .332, p \u0026lt; .01) this effect becomes stronger among consumers with a high level of original experience (ϒ = .458, p \u0026lt; .01). To statistically test the significance of this moderating effect, a Chi square difference test was run. The Chi square difference is not significant at the .10 level (∆x2 = 2.715, ∆d.f. = 3, p \u0026gt; .10). This result rejects H7a. Past experience of originals has no significant impact on relationship between emotional brand attachment and original patronage.\nEmotional brand attachment has no significant effect on counterfeit patronage among consumers with a low level of original experience (ϒ = .039, p \u0026gt; .10). This effect, although becomes slightly stronger among consumers with a high level of original experience (ϒ = .075, p \u0026gt; .10), is insignificant. To statistically test the significance of this moderating effect, a Chi square difference test was run. The Chi square difference is not significant at the .10 level (∆x2 = 2.176, ∆d.f. = 3, p \u0026gt; .10). This result rejects H7b, which suggests that relationship between emotional brand attachment and counterfeit patronage does not vary as a function of past experience of originals.\nBrand involvement has a significant and positive effect on original patronage only among consumers with a high level of original experience (ϒ = .212, p \u0026lt; .01) and no significant effect among consumers with a low level of original experience (ϒ = .143, p \u0026gt; .10). The Chi square difference is not significant at the .10 level (∆x2 = 2.238, ∆d.f. = 3, p \u0026gt; .10), which rejects H7c. Thus, past experience of originals has no significant impact on relationship between brand involvement and original patronage.\nBrand involvement shows a marginally significant and positive effect on counterfeit patronage only among consumers with a low level of original experience (ϒ = .187, p = .070) and no significant effect among consumers with a high level of original experience (ϒ = .131, p \u0026gt; .10). The Chi square difference is not significant at the .10 level (∆x2 = 2.077, ∆d.f. = 3, p \u0026gt; .10), which rejects H7d. This result suggests that past experience of originals does not affect relationship between brand involvement and counterfeit patronage.\nModerating model: counterfeit experience as moderator # Regarding the second moderator, counterfeit experience, the measures of overall fit of the moderated model mostly meet conventional standards, which suggests that the model fits the data well (χ2/df = .849, RMSEA = .000, SRMR = .016, NFI = .995, and CFI = 1.000). As with consumer original patronage, the results confirm a positive moderating effect of counterfeit experience on the relationship between emotional brand engagement and original patronage. Although emotional brand attachment has a significant and positive effect on original patronage among consumers with a low level of original experience (ϒ = .448, p \u0026lt; .01) this effect becomes slightly weaker among consumers with a high level of counterfeit experience (ϒ = .394, p \u0026lt; .01). To statistically test the significance of this moderating effect, a Chi square difference test was run. The Chi square difference is not significant at the .10 level (∆x2 = .861, ∆d.f. = 3, p \u0026gt; .10). This result rejects H8a. Thus, past experience of counterfeits has no significant impact on relationship between emotional brand attachment and original patronage.\nEmotional brand attachment has no significant effect on counterfeit patronage among consumers with a low level of counterfeit experience (ϒ = .067, p \u0026gt; .10). This effect becomes slightly weaker among consumers with a high level of original experience (ϒ = .027, p \u0026gt; .10) and is insignificant. To statistically test the significance of this moderating effect, a Chi square difference test was run. The Chi square difference is not significant at the .10 level (∆x2 = 0.925, ∆d.f. = 3, p \u0026gt; .10). This result rejects H8b. This result reveals that past experience of counterfeits does not significantly affect relationship between emotional brand attachment and counterfeit patronage.\nBrand involvement has a significant and positive effect on original patronage only among consumers with a low level of counterfeit experience (ϒ = .238, p \u0026lt; .01) and no significant effect among consumers with a high level of counterfeit experience (ϒ = .086, p \u0026gt; .10). The Chi square difference is not significant at the .10 level (∆x2 = 1.912, ∆d.f. = 3, p \u0026gt; .10), which does not support H8c. This result suggests that past counterfeit experience has no significant impact on relationship between brand involvement and original patronage.\nBrand involvement has a marginally significant and positive effect on counterfeit patronage only among consumers with a high level of counterfeit experience (ϒ = .195, p = .087) but no significant effect among consumers with a low level of counterfeit experience (ϒ = .134, p \u0026gt; .10). The Chi square difference is not significant at the .10 level (∆x2 = 1.064, ∆d.f. = 3, p \u0026gt; .10), which rejects H8d. This result advises that past experience of counterfeit does not affect relationship between brand involvement and counterfeit patronage.\nDiscussion and conclusion # Theoretical implications # Building on existing emotional brand attachment and brand involvement literature (e.g., Dunn and Hoegg 2014; Park et al. 2010; Thomson et al. 2005; Mittal and Lee 1989; Leckie et al. 2016) this research makes substantial theoretical contributions. While the literature has established the prominent role played by emotional brand attachment in determination of brand performance (e.g., Japutra et al. 2018; Hung and Lu 2018; Japutra et al. 2014), the comparative strength of influence of emotional brand attachment versus brand involvement, the two most pertinent concepts on consumption behavior of originals remained underexplored. Therefore, until this current research little knowledge existed in the literature in terms of comparative advantages/disadvantages of building emotional brand attachment as opposed to brand involvement. This knowledge gap is surprising as emotional brand attachment and brand involvement are both important contingency variables for the success of branding strategy and until comparative advantages are unveiled understanding of outcomes of emotional brand attachment would remain incomplete. This research is one of the first which reveals that emotional brand attachment plays a more dominant role compared to brand involvement in determining consumer patronage of originals. The findings of this research bridge a substantial knowledge void and advance the debate by presenting empirical evidence of the distinct influence of emotional brand attachment and brand involvement.\nDiffering to Kauffman et al. (2016) which reports a negative effect of emotional brand attachment on counterfeit purchase intention, the findings of this research suggest otherwise. Specifically, emotional brand attachment has no statistically significant impact on consumer counterfeit patronage. These differences could be attributed to distinct research contexts as well as brands examined. Kauffman et al. (2016) was conducted in Brazil and data was collected from a homogeneous female population, whereas data of this research was collected from Chinese consumers, including males and females. These inconsistent findings imply that effect of emotional brand attachment is very likely to be context specific, which also opens a new avenue for future research.\nThe findings of this research reveal a positive influence of brand involvement on counterfeit patronage. This finding is surprising because the relevant literature indicates a negative (rather than positive) effect of brand involvement on counterfeit purchase intention. The possible explanation to this unexpected finding is that consumers are attracted to excitements associated with the counterfeit’s purchasing process (e.g., the thrill of the hunt), belongingness (e.g., being part of a secret society), and personal interest in counterfeits (Bian et al. 2016), all of which are brand involvement essentials. Acknowledging that much has been done in recent years in study of counterfeit-related consumption behavior, taking a novel brand management strategy perspective this research advances the understanding of competitive advantages of emotional brand attachment versus brand involvement methods in relation to protecting originals from their counterparts, namely counterfeits. The findings of this research are one of the first which provide empirical evidence that improving brand involvement would contribute to demand for counterfeits. In contrast, enhancing emotional brand attachment is unlikely to result in undesirable impact.\nThis research also contributes to the literature through testing boundary conditions of emotional brand attachment and brand involvement effect on both originals and counterfeits. Specifically, differing to most of prior studies this research explores the indirect rather than the direct effect of past experience. The findings suggest that effect of emotional brand attachment and brand involvement do not vary as a function of past experience of either originals or counterfeits. This research is one of the few, which provides empirical evidence and rules out the possible moderating effects of past experience on the relationships between emotional brand attachment/brand involvement and original/counterfeit patronage.\nManagerial implications # From a practical implication perspective, the findings of this research are of significant importance to managers. Specifically, according to the findings, emotional brand attachment plays a more dominant role than brand involvement in determining consumer patronage of originals. Thus, when a company is strategizing to enhance its brand performance, although both will lead to positive results, focusing on establishing a stronger emotional brand attachment will result in a better outcome (statistically significant) compared to that of brand involvement. To this end, practitioners could implement the following four methods (Malär et al. 2011): incorporation of consumers’ selves, focusing on authentic branding, reconsidering aspirational branding, and individualizing branding efforts. This research also suggest that increased emotional brand attachment will improve brand performance but does not escalate consumer counterfeit patronage. However, increased brand involvement although leads to higher demand for originals, it also results in increased consumer patronage of counterfeits. Therefore, to enhance brand performance and in the same time to protect brand equity from counterfeits, originals also need to particularly focus on building emotional brand attachment over brand involvement with their consumers.\nThe findings related to the effect of past experience on consumer patronage of originals and counterfeits are very important and highly relevant to practitioners considering the fact that counterfeits are getting more openly accessible to consumers both online and offline (Jin 2012; Antonopoulos and Hall 2018). In addition, a growing number of consumers are inclined to purchase counterfeits (Bian 2018), which will undoubtedly result in an increasing level of counterfeit experience among consumers. Original intellectual property owners are very concerned that increased consumer counterfeit experience might largely mitigate marketing endeavors. Despite the concern of practitioners, the findings of this research suggest that the level of previous experience of either originals or counterfeits have no significant impact on relationship between emotional brand attachment/involvement and consumer patronage of originals/counterfeits. These findings would inform decision-making of practitioners, policy makers, and law-enforcement officials in terms of focus of attention and allocation of anti-counterfeiting resources. Although it sounds controversial, the findings of this research imply that anti-counterfeiting effort focusing on reducing availability of counterfeits might not lead to fruitful anti-counterfeiting outcomes as one would expect.\nAs assuring as they are, the findings of this research needs to be read with caution given the research was conducted in China, which is the hub of counterfeits where buying and using counterfeits are socially acceptable (Cheung and Prendergast 2006). In addition, China is a place where consumers crave luxury brands and purchase originals and counterfeits for different usage situations (Bian et al. 2016). Based on these considerations, the practical implications of this finding are very likely to be context specific.\nLimitations and future research directions # As with many other studies this research is not without limitations. For example, the current research has measured one outcome variable, patronage of originals and counterfeits, which mainly captured consumers’ interest and purchase tendency. As much contribution as this research brings to both brand management and counterfeit literature, it is unclear whether the findings of this research would hold true for more downstream variables, for example actual behavior, post-purchase evaluation, and word-of-mouth. Testing the conceptual framework with more downstream variables is a viable direction for future research.\nAlthough the sample size of this research is statistically adequate, it is relatively small and is treated as unidimensional. Future research could replicate this research using a larger sample size in different research contexts, for example distinct geographic locations. This research only captured data concerning luxury brands; thus, findings might not necessarily be applicable to generic brands, which are also heavily counterfeited. Further research in this direction is needed. With a larger sample size, future research could also take into consideration of diversified motivations of counterfeit consumption purchase. Last (but not least), despite the commonly shared concern that consumer past experience would mitigate marketing effort of originals, our data suggest otherwise. Specifically, moderation effect of both past original experience and counterfeit experience does not exist. This finding, although supported by empirical data, is surprising and should be viewed with caution. Future research needs to validate this finding using data from different contexts, for example the USA and UK, where counterfeits are also widely accessible and regularly purchased.\nReferences # Ainsworth, M.D.S., M.C.

MARKER.\n(From the Laboratories Medicine, of the Departments State University of of Physiology and Internal Iowa, Iowa City.)\n(Received for publication, June 12, 1915.)\nThe search for possible precursors of creatine has always led to a consideration of substances containing the guanidine radicle, as arginine and glycocyamine, or methylamino groups, as sarcosine, betaine, and choline.\nVan Hoogenhuyze and Verploegh2 found no increase in the elimination of creatinine, after the ingestion of proteins relatively rich in arginine. Jaffe3 did not observe an increase in the urinary creatinine after the injection of arginine into rabbits. Thompson4 found that the bulk (73 to 96 per cent) of the admin- istered arginine nitrogen appears as urea in the urine. Inouye5, however, believes that an increase in creatine occurs when argin- ine is added to cat liver, or is perfused through the organ.\nThe present investigation was concerned with possible creatine formation resulting from the action of voluntary muscle on arginine and methylureidoacetic acid. The conversion of arginine into creatine would probably involve a deamination, oxidation, and methylation of the base.\nThis is an Open Access article under the CC BY license.\nMethylureidoacetic acid has not been found in animal tissues, but recently Ackermann6 demonstrated the presence of its anhydride N-methylhydantoin among the putrefaction products of creatinine. The transformation of methylureidoacetic into methylguanidinoacetic acid would be effected by substitution of the keto oxygen by the imino group. This might possibly occur in vivo by reaction of the oxygen atom with ammonia.\nThe substances under investigation were placed in contact with hashed muscle and perfused through this tissue.\nEXPERIMENTAL DATA AND RESULTS. # The arginine was obtained from edestin by the method of Kossel and Kutscher.7 The pure copper nitrate salt was converted into the carbonate and this was used in our experiments.\nThe methylureidoacetic acid was prepared from sarcosine and urea8 and employed as the sodium or ammonium salt.\nMuscle creatine was determined according to Baumann9, and the creatine in the blood and perfusates by an adaptation of this method. 25 cc. of blood or perfusate are boiled for threehours under reflux with 62 cc. of 5 N sulphuric acid. The filtrate is diluted to 150 cc. 10 cc. are pipetted into a 50 cc. volumetric flask and exactly neutralized with 2.5 N sodium hydrate solution (litmus paper). About 7.9 cc. of alkali are required for this purpose. The solution is brought to the mark by the addition of 30 cc. of saturated picric acid and water. 25 cc. of the clear filtrate are employed for the creatinine determination. The standard contains 0.1 mg. of creatinine in 5 cc. of solution; this was diluted with 15 cc. of saturated picric acid and 5 cc. of water. 1.25 cc. of 2.5 normal alkali are added to both the standard and the unknown, and ten minutes allowed for the color to develop.\nThe water content of the muscle was determined by noting the loss after drying to constant weight in vacuo over concentrated sulphuric acid and phosphorus pentoxide at room temperature. The nitrogen was determined in 5 cc. of the muscle extract according to Kjeldahl.\nL. Baumann and J. Marker\nExperiment A.\u0026mdash;This experiment is representative of a series of similar ones. 25 gm. of hashed muscle, 25 cc. of defibrinated blood, and 10 cc. of toluene were placed in each of four flasks. Flask 3 contained in addition 1 gm. of arginine carbonate and Flask 4 1 gm. of methylureidoacetic acid neutralized with sodium hydroxide solution. Creatine determinations were made on the contents of Flask 1 immediately, and on the contents of Flasks 2, 3, and 4 at the end of approximately twenty-four hours at 37°. The muscle and blood were obtained from a dog just prior to the experiment. The absence of bacterial growth was demonstrated by smears and cultures.\nFlask 1 (Control). 2 (Control). 3 (Arginine). 4 (Methylureidoacetic acid). Creatine content 64 mg. 66 mg. 66 mg. 112\u0026ndash;50 = 62 mg. A previous trial showed that 1 gram of methylureidoacetic acid when subjected to the process employed for the determination of creatine in muscle produced a color equivalent to 50 mg. of creatine. Perfusion of the limb seemed to offer more nearly physiological conditions for studying the behavior of muscle tissue towards the substances in question, and an apparatus was constructed for this purpose. This apparatus is patterned after one which Brodie[^1O] has described.\nThe technique of perfusion was as follows: A dog was anesthetized and prepared for operation. The femoral vessels of one leg and the carotid artery were exposed, a cannula was inserted into the latter, and the dog was exsanguinated. The blood is defibrinated and filtered through cheesecloth. A measured quantity of the blood and a known volume of 0.9 per cent sodium chloride containing the substance to be perfused are well mixed. A tourniquet is placed about the limb above the point of exposure of the femoral vessels to prevent loss of fluid through the collateral vessels. The femoral vessels are then tied off and cannulas inserted. Ringer’s solution is now perfused for a short time until the fluid returns fairly colorless; this removes traces of blood which might give rise to clots and so interfere with the subsequent circulation of the perfusate. The perfusate is then placed in the receiving bottle at once and the apparatus started. The volume of the perfusate in our experiments was usually 150 cc., but a smaller quantity may be employed. An incandescent lamp placed under the limb and a reflector above it help to supply the necessary warmth to the parts. The perfusate was supplied to the limb at a temperature of 37°. This was accomplished by immersing both the receiving and pressure bottles in a constant temperature bath. A liberal supply of oxygen was bubbled through the fluid, so that the blood to the limb was a bright red, whereas the “venous” blood was colored purplish. The pressure of the perfusate fluctuated between 80 and 140 mm. of mercury.\nExperiment Q.\u0026mdash;The right hind leg of a dog weighing 5 kilos was perfused for one and a half hours with a mixture of 100 cc. of his own defibrinated blood and 50 cc. of 0.9 per cent sodium chloride solution containing 2 gm. of methylureidoacetic acid neutralized with ammonia. The pressure of the perfusate fluctuated between 80 and 100 mm. 95 cc. of fluid were regained. The semi-membranosus, tibialis anticus, and gastrocnemius muscles were removed from both sides and hashed immediately. 50 gm. samples were analyzed for creatine, and from 1 to 2 gm. served for the water determination. Creatine was also determined in the blood and perfusate. Nitrogen was determined the muscle extract.\nCreatine. Water.

None of the experiments show a decided increase in the creatine content of the perfused muscle or of the perfusate.\nWe conclude that neither arginine nor methylureidoacetic acid, under the experimental conditions outlined above, gives rise to an appreciable increase in muscle creatine.\nIn closing we wish to express our indebtedness to Prof. J.

Introduction # Where does today’s rain come from? This is a simple and important question, but no clear answer has yet been found. Generally, precipitation arises from two sources: local evaporation and externally advected moisture. Local evaporation is subject to the availability of surface water, with the magnitude of its variation much less than that of heavy rainfall. During a heavy rainfall event, rainfall-producing weather systems extend to about 3–5 times the radius of the sink region to absorb moisture (Trenberth et al., 2003). The water vapor transported by atmospheric circulation is one of the most important processes in the hydrological cycle.\nSoutheast China experiences a typical monsoon climate and shows great seasonal variability in its moisture circulation. In the summer half year, the East Asian summer monsoon prevails: abundant moisture is imported by the south-west flow from the Indian Ocean, the southeast flow from the western North Pacific (WNP), and the cross-equatorial flow from the southern hemisphere (Li et al., 2012). In the winter half year, the northeast winter monsoon prevails: South-east China tends to lack moisture, except for limited moisture transported by the midlatitude westerly and the southwesterly ahead of the India–Burma trough (Qin et al., 1991; Li et al., 2010). At the synoptic scale, a large supply of moisture makes Southeast China vulnerable to heavy rainstorms (Tao and Ding, 1981; Ding, 1994; Bao and Huang, 2006). Generally, three typical types of heavy rainstorms can be categorized based on their triggering systems. One is caused by a quasi-stationary front in the first rainy season (April to June) with a subtropical high anchoring to the south of South-east China. The second is attributed to the persistence of a depression—typically, a landed tropical cyclone—in the second rainy season (July to September; Bao, 2007). The last type is triggered by a sudden outbreak of strong cold air activity conflicting with preexisting warm and humid air outside the rainy seasons.\n© Institute of Atmospheric Physics/Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016\n320 DETECTING SEASONAL VARIATION OF MOISTURE ORIGIN VOLUME 33\nPrevious studies on moisture sources have been based mainly on water vapor flux, which is qualitative. A more objective and quantitative investigation is therefore desirable to study the importance of each moisture source. The Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYS- PLIT) model (Draxler and Rolph, 2003), which traces air particles released at any height and location backward and calculates specific meteorological variables along the trajectories by solving the Lagrangian equation, is now widely applied in the study of moisture origins of extreme precipitation (e.g., Draxler and Rolph, 2003; Stohl et al., 2003). An analysis of the specific humidity along a backward trajectory allows an exploration of the role of air particles in transporting moisture and the possible moisture origin where evaporation occurs. By applying HYSPLIT, Gustafsson et al. (2010) found that moisture crosses continental Europe and the Baltic Sea before arriving in southern Sweden during extreme summer precipitation. Fuhrmann and Konrad II (2013) found that snowfall and ice storms in central North Carolina entrain different moisture sources, with the former over the Caribbean Sea and the latter over the Gulf of Mexico and the Carolina coast. Brimelow and Reuter (2005) found that the low-level moisture feeding three extreme rainfall events over the southern Mackenzie River basin could be traced back to the Gulf of Mexico. Over China, Jiang et al. (2011) pointed out that moisture sources vary during different phases of heavy rainfall over the Huaihe valley.\nIn this study, the HYSPLIT model was applied to detect the possible pathways of the moisture responsible for precipitation over Southeast China. The data are described briefly in section 2. The seasonal variations in moisture origins and paths are examined in section 3, based on the results from a HYSPLIT run during 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013. The moisture sources of three typical heavy rainfall events are studied in section 4 to investigate the similarities within each category and the dissimilarities among different categories. A summary and further discussion are provided in section 5.\n2. Data and methodology # Gauge-based daily precipitation data during 1979–2012 from 756 stations over China, subjected to quality control procedures by the China Meteorological Administration (Bao, 2007), were used to count the regional durative heavy rainfall events over Southeast China. They were defined preliminarily, referring to the study of Bao (2007), as processes in a region in which 3-day precipitation exceeded 100 mm and daily precipitation exceeded 25 mm. The threshold of the region size was over 10 stations within a flexible rectangle containing 50 grids with a 1° × 1° horizontal resolution over Southeast China (21°–28°N, 105°–120°E).\nGridded 3D wind field data from the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset, with a temporal resolution of 6 hours, a horizontal resolution of 1° ×1°, and a vertical resolution of 26 levels from 1000 hPa to 125 hPa (Dee et al., 2011), were imported into the HYSPLIT model to trace the air particles responsible for the precipitation over Southeast China and to calculate specific meteorological variables along the trajectories, including altitude and specific humidity. In the seasonal run, air particles released over Southeast China (21° –28° N, 105° –120° E) at 1500 m with a horizontal resolution of 1° × 1° during 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013 were traced backward every 6 hours with a backward duration of 9 days, which is the approximate residence time of moisture in the atmosphere (Eagleson, 1970). The height of 1500 m was selected because the circulation at this level can well represent the lower-level circulation that transports most of the moisture. In the extreme precipitation run, on the other hand, the model setting was the same except the vertical resolution was set as 500 m from the surface to 8000 m. Only the first 100 trajectories that contributed the most moisture during heavy rainfall events are shown.\n3.Seasonal variation of moisture sources detected by HYSPLIT # To observe moisture routines systematically, the trajectories were clustered separately for the boreal summer (1 April to 30 September 2012) and winter half year (1 October 2012 to 31 March 2013) by using the Curve Clustering Toolbox (Gaffney, 2004). In selecting the number of clusters (k), the in-sample log-likelihood value was calculated. This is defined as the log-probability of the observed data under the model, akin to a goodness-of-fit metric for probabilistic models (Gaffney, 2004). As is often the case, the log-likelihood values increased continuously with the number of clusters. The curves in Fig. 1 show diminishing returns in terms of improvement in fit beyond k = 6 for the 1 April to 30 September 2012 run, and k = 4 for the 1 October 2012 to 31 March 2013 run, suggesting that these were reasonable stopping points for the cluster analysis. Hence, for the following analysis, 6 and 4 were selected as the number of clusters for the summer and winter half-year trajectories, respectively. The variation in the altitude and specific humidity along the clustered trajectories was also examined. The specific humidity declines within Southeast China were accumulated to represent the contribution of each clustered trajectory to the moisture supply over Southeast China.\n3.1. Moisture source in the summer half year # Six groups of moisture transport paths were identified for Southeast China during the summer half year (Fig. 2). Four key transport paths from the ocean (groups 2–5) contribute 16%, 31%, 20%, and 10% of the moisture to Southeast China, respectively. The most important one (group 3) originates from the South China Sea and Bay of Bengal (SCS–BOB). It dominates the moisture transport in April and May before the onset of the Indian summer monsoon (Fig. 2c). The second most important one (group 4) originates from the central Indian Ocean and crosses the Indo-China Peninsula to Southeast China. It plays a key role in transporting moisture during May to August when the Indian summer monsoon is active (Fig. 2c). The transport path from the western Indian Ocean (group 5) contributes only half the moisture that the path from the central Indian Ocean does, and appears mainly in June and July when the Indian summer monsoon is solidly built up. Another path (group 2) from the WNP contributes around 16% of the moisture supply; it dominates in August and September when Southeast China is under the control of the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH). The other two routines (groups 1 and 6) come from the north at higher latitudes. One is from northern China and crosses the coastal region before reaching Southeast China, with additional trajectories from the immediate neighborhood; its contribution (20%) is equal to that from the central Indian Ocean. The other routine originates from continental Asia and reaches Southeast China from the northwest. It makes a limited contribution (3%), as the moisture content along it is low. These two transport paths appear mainly in the early and later stages of the summer half year, which can probably be attributed to cold air activity in the reversal of seasons. Hence, based on HYSPLIT, the contributions of different moisture transport paths can be illustrated qualitatively. In spring and summer, before the establishment of the Indian summer monsoon, most of the moisture originates from the adjacent oceans, the BOB and SCS, with cold air from the north and easterly flow advected by the WPSH playing additional roles. After the onset of the Indian summer monsoon, most of the moisture originates from the Indian Ocean and is transported by the strong southwesterly flow. In the reversal period between summer and fall, the roles of the routines from the north and the WNP enhance, while the moisture advected by the Indian summer monsoon diminishes.\nThe composited altitude and specific humidity along each clustered trajectory were also examined (Fig. 3). Except for the routine from the inland area, the other routines from the coastal region and oceans lie at low levels with high humidity (10–15 g kg−1) before reaching Southeast China. They ascend with abruptly decreasing humidity during the last two days, implying that strong upward motion is associated with moisture condensation at the destination. The inland routine lies at a height of around 4000 m, with low humidity (3 g kg−1) initially, and then descends and increases its moisture content gradually during its southward transport to the coastal region where abundant moisture can be collected. It ascends with slightly decreasing humidity in the last few hours and contributes only a small amount of moisture to Southeast China.\nMARCH 2016 LI ET AL. 321\nFig. 1. Test log-likelihood values for different numbers of backward trajectory clusters: (a) 1 April to 30 September 2012 run; (b) 1 October 2012 to 31 March 2013 run.\nFig. 2. Six groups of trajectories clustered based on the result of HYSPLIT during the boreal summer half year (1 April to 30 September 2012) with air particles released over Southeast China (21°–28°N, 105°–120°E): (a) mean trajectory of each group, with the numbers indicating the group number, percentage of trajectory amount, and the contribution to the moisture supply of each group; (b) trajectories; and (c) monthly distribution of each group.\n322 DETECTING SEASONAL VARIATION OF MOISTURE ORIGIN VOLUME 33\n3.2. Moisture source in the winter half year # Four groups of transport routines to Southeast China were identified in the winter half year (Fig. 4). Two are from the oceans, the WNP (group 2) and BOB (group 3); one is from the north, via the coastal region, before reaching Southeast China (group 1); and the last is also from the northwest but comes mainly via the inland area (group 4). In contrast to that in the summer half year, the proportion of moisture from the WNP (33%) is much larger than that from the Indian Ocean (15%), indicating that more moisture originates from the WNP than from the Indian Ocean. The moisture from the WNP dominates the moisture supply in late winter and early spring. Instead of arriving in Southeast China directly from the east in the summer half year, it rotates clockwise to the SCS, and then turns northward to Southeast China, which is closely related to the southward shift of the WPSH in the winter half year. The northern BOB contributes 22% of the trajectories but only 15% of the moisture, implying that abundant moisture from the northern BOB is transported across Southeast China without condensation, as the convergence-triggering mechanism might be absent in the winter half year. This is validated in Fig. 5, as both upward motion and specific humidity decline are weak. The path from North China also appears in the winter half year, with its trajectory amount and contribution nearly double (37%). It plays a key role in fall and early winter. Another routine, starting from southern Europe and associated with cold air activity, occupies only 15% of the moisture supply. Compared to that in the summer half year, despite the moisture content along this path being lower in the winter half year, its contribution increases dramatically, as the moisture tends to condense in the last few hours in the winter half year but not in the summer half year (Fig. 5b).\nFig. 3. (a) Mean altitude and (b) specific humidity along the six clustered trajectories from 9 days prior (−216 h) to the moment the air particles reach the destination (0 h) during the boreal summer half year (1 April to 30 September 2012).\nMARCH 2016 LI ET AL. 323\nFig. 4.

As in Fig. 3 but for the four groups during the boreal winter half year (1 October 2012 to 31 March 2013).\n324 DETECTING SEASONAL VARIATION OF MOISTURE ORIGIN VOLUME 33\nThe composited altitude and specific humidity along the trajectories in the winter half year (Fig. 5) show that the path from the WNP is located at a low level (around 1000 m), which has the highest moisture content. The path from North China descends to an even lower level and collects abundant moisture over the coastal region before reaching Southeast China. These two routines are uplifted at the destination, with humidity decreasing as moisture condenses. The path from the northwest originates at a high level with low moisture content; the humidity increases slightly before reaching the destination but does not decrease at the destination due to the lack of ascending motion, as does the routine from the northern BOB.\n4. Moisture source of heavy rainfall events detected by HYSPLIT # Twenty-one regional durative heavy rainfall events were identified (Table 1). Most take place in June (38.1%) and July (19.0%), when the East Asian summer monsoon prevails. Some events occur in August (14.3%) and September (9.5%) and are closely related to the landfall of tropical storms. Some events appear in spring (14.3%) and late fall (4.8%), outside the rainy season. These might be triggered by vigorous cold air activity. The atmospheric circulations at different levels and the best track data from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center advisories were examined to subjectively classify three types of heavy rainfall events based on their dominant moisture circulations: (1) tropical storms; (2) interaction of the westward WPSH and cold air activity in the summer half year; and (3) strong cold air activity in the winter half year. In the following analysis, the trajectories responsible for the moisture supply during each type of heavy rainfall event are examined in detail to reveal the similarity in moisture origins and paths for each type and the differences between the types, and to compare the seasonal variation between heavy rainfall events.\nTable 1. Regional heavy rainfall processes over Southeast China during 1979–2010. Based on the dominant circulations, all processes were classified into three types: (I) tropical storms; (II) interaction of the westward WPSH and cold air activity in the summer half year; and (III) strong cold air activity in the winter half year.\nNo. Date (LST) Type 1 6–8 Apr 1981 III 2 15–18 Jun 1982 II 3 31 Aug to 2 Sep 1984 I 4 27–29 Aug 1985 I 5 29–31 Jul 1987 II 6 30 Jun to 2 Jul 1989 II 7 20–22 Aug 1990 I 8 9–11 Sep 1990 I 9 25–28 Mar 1992 III 10 18–20 Jun 1994 II 11 15–17 Jun 1995 II 12 2–4 Aug 1995 II 13 7–9 Mar1998 III 14 19–22 Jun 1998 II 15 9–11 Jun 2000 II 16 17–19 Jul 2000 I 17 20–22 Jun 2005 II 18 15–17 Jul 2006 I 19 7–10 Jun 2007 II 20 12–14 Jun 2008 II 21 31 Oct to 2 Nov 2008 III 4.1. Tropical storm landing # Seven out of 21 heavy rainfall events were directly or indirectly coupled with the landing of tropical storms. A case during 15–17 July 2006, in which accumulated rainfall reached 500 mm, was examined. It was caused by tropical storm Bilis, which interacted intensively with the south-west summer monsoon after its landing; abundant moisture transported by the monsoon flow and strong convergence within the storm created favorable conditions for this disastrous heavy rainfall event (Zhang and Kong, 2007; Zhou, 2008; Ye and Li, 2011).\nSeveral prominent features appear in the daily vertically integrated water vapor flux (Fig. 6a). First, the southwesterly moisture transport by the summer monsoon from the western Indian Ocean is strong. Secondly, Bilis is a center of moisture convergence; strong moisture convergence is triggered by the tropical storm and dominates Southeast China as Bilis is sustained for several days after landfall, which is crucial to the persistence of precipitation. Thirdly, the enhanced WPSH shifts westward, to the east of the landed Bilis (figure not shown), preventing further transport of southwesterly moisture flow and impelling the gathering of moisture and unstable energy over Southeast China.\nThis rainfall was dominated by the conjunction of a typical storm, the southwest summer monsoon, and the WPSH. Whether all these contributed to the moisture supply remains obscure from the analysis of water vapor flux. To address this question, the air particles released over Southeast China during 15–17 July 2006 were traced backward; the first 100 trajectories that contributed the most moisture are shown in Fig. 7a. The trajectories tend to originate over the eastern BOB–WNP. Compared to the summer half-year, in which moisture trajectories are from the western Indian Ocean when the Indian summer monsoon is strong (Fig. 2), the sources of moisture accompanying Bilis tend to be more localized. The storm plays a crucial role in gathering moisture and uplifting it to the condensation level. All moisture transport routines are rotated cyclonically when they get close to South-east China. The average uplift height is above 7000 km (Fig. 7a), higher than that in the other types (Figs. 7b–c), which might be attributable to the strong upward motion accompanying the tropical cyclone. The specific humidity declines from around 18 to 4 g kg−1, indicating that most of the moisture is condensed into precipitation.\nMARCH 2016 LI ET AL. 325\nFig. 6. Averaged vertically integrated water vapor flux (vectors; units: kg m−1 s−1) and its divergence (color scale; 10−4 kg m−2 s−1) during (a) 15–17 July 2006, (b) 20–22 June 2005, and (c) 7–9 March 1998.\nFig. 7.

The upper panels show the first 100 trajectories, and the middle and lower panels show the variation in altitude and specific humidity along the trajectories, respectively, with the black lines showing the value averaged among the 100 trajectories.\nThe backward trajectories for the other tropical cyclone– induced heavy rainfall events are also shown in Fig. 8. Several features can be identified. First, all trajectories are rotated cyclonically when they get close to the tropical cyclone. Second, the WNP acts as an important source in the tropical storm–induced heavy rainfall events, which is reasonable, as all tropical storms affecting Southeast China originate in the WNP or SCS. This is also quite consistent with previous results in which most of the trajectories from the WNP appear in late summer, as in addition to the advection of the WPSH, tropical storms also play a role. Thirdly, the average uplift height of the air particles induced by tropical storms is high (around 7000 m), except for the case during 17–19 July 2000, which was induced by a weak and short-lived storm over the SCS.\n4.2. Interaction of the westward WPSH and cold air activity in the summer half year # In the summer half year, cold air activity weakens and retreats to the north; however, when it is strong enough, it can invade southward and interact with low-latitude systems. Prefrontal warm-sector heavy rainfall is among the most common events during the first rainy season in South-east China (Tao et al., 1980). During 17–24 June 2005, a record-breaking heavy rainfall event hit Southeast China, with daily rainfall amounts on three consecutive days in Longmen County of 312.3, 355.0, and 310.6 mm (Xia and Zhao, 2009). It was a result of the combined effects of the midlevel East Asian trough, the lower-level shear line and quasi-stationary front, with the heavy rainfall occurring in the warm sector (Xia and Zhao, 2009). The WPSH enhanced and shifted southwestward and dominated the northern SCS. The conflict between the cold air guided by the midlevel trough and the humid air carried by the southwesterly flow resulted in this heavy rainfall event.\n326 DETECTING SEASONAL VARIATION OF MOISTURE ORIGIN VOLUME 33\nFig. 8. The first 100 trajectories that lost the most humidity during the last 24 hours before reaching Southeast China in regional heavy rainfall cases of landfalling type I tropical storms, except during 15–17 July 2006: (a) 31 August to 2 September 1984; (b) 27–29 August 1985; (c) 20–22 August 1990; (d) 9–11 September 1990; and (e) 17–19 July 2000. The upper panels show the first 100 trajectories, and the middle and lower panels show the variation in altitude and specific humidity along the trajectories, respectively, with the black lines showing the average among the 100 trajectories. The invasion of cold air acted as a trigger for heavy rainfall; however, without sufficient moisture supply, only light or even no rainfall could be stimulated. In this case, abundant moisture diverged over the western Indian Ocean was carried by the energetic Indian summer monsoon to South-east China, where it conflicted with the steering circulation of the southwestward-shifted WPSH (Fig. 6b). A strong Indian summer monsoon is crucial to moisture transport from the Indian Ocean to Southeast China, while the WPSH not only acts as a dynamic barrier blocking the downstream movement of the East Asia trough and thus the persistent cold air invasion (figure not shown), but also redirects the southwesterly moisture transport to Southeast China.\nMARCH 2016 LI ET AL. 327\nFig. 9.

In (a, c) trajectories with different colors represent different clusters, and the black line represents the composited trajectory of each cluster; in (c, d) trajectories with different colors represent clustering results in each heavy rainfall case.\nThe output of HYSPLIT (Fig. 7b) provides even more accurate information on the origins and paths of the moisture. Besides the western Indian Ocean, the central Indian Ocean is an important moisture source, as cross-equatorial flow is strong over that area several days before (figure not shown). According to previous results, these are two crucial moisture origins responsible for the moisture supply to Southeast China in summer when the Indian summer monsoon is active. The moisture from the WNP does not play a role in this process, implying that the WPSH helps only to redirect moisture transport but not to supply moisture from the WNP.\nThe composition of the moisture transport paths was also studied, based on the clustering result of trajectories for all regional heavy rainfall events (Fig. 9a) and each regional heavy rainfall event (Fig. 9b) of this type. It is shown that the western Indian Ocean, central Indian Ocean, and SCS are three key moisture sources; they were also crucial in the seasonal study. However, it is interesting to note that, in contrast to the seasonal characteristics, the importance of the western Indian Ocean is nearly twice that of the SCS. This implies that the cooperation of a strong Indian summer monsoon is essential to the heavy rainfall induced by the westward WPSH and cold air activity in the summer half year, as it transports a great deal of moisture to the rainfall region. In addition, though cold air activity plays a crucial role in triggering heavy rainfall (Xia and Zhao, 2009), it does not play a key role in supplying moisture in all regional heavy rainfall events of this type, which seems to conflict with the previous conclusion that 20% of the moisture in the summer half year is from the north and the immediate neighborhood. This might be because only the first 100 trajectories that lost the most humidity, rather than all trajectories, are shown in the analysis of regional heavy rainfall events (Fig. 9), in comparison with the seasonal analysis (Fig. 2). The routine from the north and immediate neighborhood might make a weak contribution, if any, in transporting moisture during the heavy rainfall events in the summer half year, which might be one distinguishing feature of the moisture sources between heavy rainfall events and the seasonal analysis.\n4.3. Cold air activity in the winter half year # In spring/fall, when the northerly flow is relatively weak, humid and warm air may affect South China. When there is a sudden outbreak of strong cold air activity, the conflict between the southward-invading cold air and the preexisting warm air may trigger heavy rainfall. It was found that all heavy rainfall events outside summer (6–8 April 1981, 25–28 March 1992, 7–9 March 1998, and 31 October to 2 November 2008) occurred in a similar atmospheric pattern; that is, with a westerly flow, an anticyclone advecting abundant moisture into Southeast China from the east, and northerly flow from inland bringing cold air. The heavy rainfall during 7–9 March 1998 was the strongest rainfall in early March since 1979, inducing great damage and loss.\n328 DETECTING SEASONAL VARIATION OF MOISTURE ORIGIN VOLUME 33\nIn the analysis of water vapor flux, the moisture converged over Southeast China during this heavy rainfall was supplied by two branches. One was transported by the westerly flow at the same latitude and the other was transported by an anticyclonic circulation over the SCS–WNP from the tropical WNP (Fig. 6c). Cold air activity did not play a direct role in moisture transport, as the northern boundary of Southeast China was dominated by weak southerly rather than northerly transport. Instead, it played an indirect role in the formation of the anticyclone over the SCS–WNP. In the early stage, the routine of the cold air lay mainly to the east over the ocean, where it turned clockwise toward Southeast China and converged with the westerly flow (Figure not shown). The cold air may have absorbed abundant moisture over the ocean. When the heavy rainfall took place, the other new branch of cold air from the north conflicted with the warm and humid air from the south, resulting in a strong uplifting of moisture.\nThe backward trajectories responsible for this heavy rainfall verify the role played by cold air activity in the moisture supply (Fig. 7c). The crucial trajectories originated from Northeast China and transported clockwise over the SCS–WNP before reaching Southeast China, where abundant moisture was absorbed. This was also proposed as the most important path for moisture transport in the winter half year in the last section. The westerly flow only played an additional role in this process.\nA composite analysis of the moisture transport routines in the winter half year is shown in Figs. 9c and d. For the heavy rainfall events in the winter half year, most of the moisture originates from the WNP. Three paths from the WNP together contribute 71% of the moisture. They differ slightly in origins and paths, which might be determined by the location of the anticyclone over the WNP. The paths from the north and west contribute only 15% and 14% of the moisture, respectively. Despite other studies having suggested that westerly transport or moisture transport from the BOB are important sources of moisture in Southeast China, the present results using HYSPLIT show that the WNP is the key origin of moisture.\n5. Conclusion and discussion # The origins and paths of moisture supplied to Southeast China were investigated using the HYSPLIT model with trajectories of air particles released over Southeast China during 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013 and three typical regional durative heavy rainfall events. Compared to water vapor flux, the results from HYSPLIT are much more quantitative and objective. In the boreal summer half year, four key transport paths from the oceans—the WNP, SCS-BOB, central Indian Ocean, and western Indian Ocean—contribute 16%, 31%, 20%, and 10% of the moisture to Southeast China, respectively. They experience strong upward motion and condensation within Southeast China. Coupled with the evolution of monsoon activity, the importance of each path shows great intraseasonal variation. In contrast to the summer half year, more moisture originates from the WNP (33%) than from the Indian Ocean (15%) in the winter half year. The path from North China plays a key role in winter moisture supply, with its trajectory amount and contribution nearly doubling (37%) those in the summer half year.\nDuring tropical storm–induced heavy rainfall, all moisture transport routines are rotated cyclonically by the peripheral circulation of the storm before it reaches Southeast China. The invasion of cold air can cause heavy rainfall in both the summer and winter half year, but it plays different roles in the moisture supply. In the winter half year, the routine of the cold air invasion responsible for heavy rainfall is located farther eastward than that in the summer half year. The cold air crosses the WNP, absorbs abundant moisture, and then transports it into Southeast China, thereby acting as a crucial moisture transport path. In contrast, in the summer half year, the cold air invasion over the inland area can stimulate heavy rainfall only if abundant moisture supplied by other systems is superimposed. The invasion of cold air plays a key role in converging and uplifting the moisture but not in transporting the moisture. Instead, the cooperation of a strong Indian summer monsoon is essential to the moisture supply during heavy rainfall events induced by the westward WPSH and cold air activity in the summer half year.\nIn this study, only the period during 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013 was selected to analyze the seasonal variation in moisture transport, which is obviously not a long enough time span. Further analysis over longer periods would be of value. However, the period during April 2012 to March 2013 is still highly representative, as the dry/wet conditions over South-east China during this period were normal. The percentages of the abnormal precipitation in the summer half year, winter half year, and the whole year are 2%, 14%, and 5%, respectively; all are below 0.6σ (standard deviation). Though the HYSPLIT model is superior to water vapor flux in detecting moisture origins, caution is still advised, as it is the air particles rather than the moisture itself that are traced in the HYSPLIT model. The moisture within the air particles may experience condensation or evaporation on its path; however, the long-standing humidity content over the oceans makes it hard to tell where the moisture condenses or evaporates by analyzing the variation of the specific humidity along the trajectories. Nonetheless, the HYSPLIT model was still a useful tool for detecting the moisture transport routines in this study.\nAcknowledgements.

As more and more products with a specific botanical composition specified on the label are produced (e.g. rye vodkas, wheat vodkas and Polish Vodka, which cannot be produced with the addition of maize distillate), it is necessary to look for quicker and more accurate methods allowing the determination of botanical origin of alcoholic beverages and materials used to their production. The aim of this study is to verify the usefulness of the electronic nose based on the ultra-fast gas chromatography for quick differentiation between agricultural distillates according to their botanical origin. Nineteen samples included distillates from rye, triticale, wheat and maize were used for the research. For data analysis, the following methods were used: PCA—Principal Component Analysis, DFA—Discriminant Function Analysis, SIMCA classification (SIMCA—Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogies) and SQC—Statistical Quality Control. The use of the electronic nose with ultra-fast gas chromatography and the use of DFA and SIMCA analyses allowed differentiation between agricultural distillates according to their botanical origin.\nKeywords Raw spirits .

The regulation defines the minimum alcoholic strength by volume, which should be 96.0 % vol., and the maximum levels of some compounds, such as esters up to 1.3 g/hl of alcohol 100 % vol. (expressed in grams of ethyl acetate), aldehydes 0.5 g/hl (expressed in grams of acetaldehyde), higher alcohols 0.5 g/hl (expressed in grams of 2-methyl-1-propanol) and methanol 30 g/hl.\nThe composition of agricultural distillates is influenced by the material, from which it is produced and fermentation conditions, including, amongst other things, tanks, in which this process is conducted and the distillation process (Tarko 2006). During the fermentation process conducted using yeasts, volatile and non-volatile by-products are produced, apart from ethanol, which influence the quality of the alcohol. Non-volatile substances, which remain in the dry mass of the mash, include sugars which have not been fully fermented, cellulose, substances containing nitrogen compounds, and mineral salts. Non-volatile substances, which remain in the brew, include glycerine and acids, e.g. lactic acid. Volatile substances, which enter the distillate as by-products, can include the following groups of compounds: methanol, higher alcohols, esters, fatty acids, carbonyl compounds, i.e. aldehydes, ketones, acetals and other (Tarko 2006; Stanisz et al. 2009). As previously mentioned, the concentrations of these products largely depend on the material, from which the distillate is produced. Raw spirits can be produced from different materials like grain, potato, beet, sugar cane, molasses or other products contain starch. In the industry, agricultural distillates produced for human consumption are usually made from grains or potato. Each of the distillate differs in composition due to materials from which they are made. For example, raw spirits obtained from triticale contain relatively small amounts of acids, esters, methanol and higher alcohols, as compared to rye distillates (Pietruszka et al. 2010).\nEthanol is the main component of the matrices of agricultural distillates; however, apart from it, these matrices are characterised by the presence of a large number of compounds at low concentrations originating from various groups. As a result, tests of the composition of agricultural distillates are not easy, due to legal requirements (Tarko 2006), which must be complied with so that a distillate can be used for the production of spirit beverages and also due to the large number of compounds influencing the quality of spirits. It is very important that research should be conducted, which will allow for defining characteristic features of spirits and for assessing the quality of the products and their processing. Research is usually conducted using gas chromatography to determine the composition of specific compounds or a group of compounds (determination of aldehydes in raw spirits made from potato (Czupryński and Kotarska 2009), esters in grain distillates (Plutowska and Wardencki 2008) and quality assessment of grain spirits (Plutowska et al. 2010; Wardencki et al. 2009)). Attempts have been also made to distinguish between agricultural distillates according to their botanical origin using gas chromatography by Jeleń et al. 2010 (raw spirits made from rye, potato and corn), Ziółkowska and Jeleń 2012 (agricultural distillates produced from rye, corn and potato) and Biernacka and Wardencki 2012 (raw spirits made from rye, corn, wheat and triticale); however, they did not allow for accurate differentiation between all tested distillates and the method itself was relatively long. As more and more products with a specific botanical composition specified on the label are produced (e.g. rye vodkas, wheat vodkas and Polish Vodka, which cannot be produced with the addition of maize distillate), it is necessary to look for quicker and more accurate methods allowing the determination of botanical origin.\nThe aim of this study is to verify the usefulness of the electronic nose based on the ultra-fast gas chromatography Heracles II form Alpha MOS Co. (Toulouse, France) for quick differentiation between agricultural distillates according to their botanical origin. The results of this study may contribute to the development of quality control of products and a more efficient assessment of materials for the production of spirit drinks with a composition specified on the label. Conducted research improves a product authentication for such alcohols as Polish vodkas, which in the near future can constitute a background for supplementation of law regulations or be a basis of the new ones.\nMaterials and Methods # Materials # Agricultural distillates obtained from Destylarnia Sobieski S.A. (Poland, Pomeranian Province) and the Żyrardów distillery (Poland, Mazovian Province) were used for analysis. Distillates were produced in the smaller breweries located across whole area of Poland, namely they were from Kołaczkowo, Jawty Wielkie, Lotyń, Rąbczyn, Brzostowo, Skrzatusz, Wielka Klonia, Kęsowo and then delivered to the above-mentioned distilleries. The samples included distillates from three rye cultivars (eight samples), two triticale cultivars (four samples), three wheat cultivars (three samples) and two maize cultivars (four samples). All of distillates, which have been used, were good quality.\nMethods # Sample Preparation # All samples were prepared using the same analytical procedure. This is connected with similar ethanol concentrations in the tested samples and a similar composition of materials used for the production. About 6.25 ml of water and 1.75 ml of agricultural distillate were added to the vial. Next, the samples were mixed and analysed using the electronic nose. Depending on the amount of the sample, three or two repetitions were performed.\nElectronic Nose Analysis # An electronic nose based on ultra-fast gas chromatography by Alpha MOS (Toulouse, France) was used for the research. It is equipped with a sorption trap, a dispenser allowing for the introduction of a gas or liquid sample, two flame ionisation detectors (FID), dedicated AlphaSoft V12 software with implemented modules for chromatographic, chemometric, and sensory analysis of characteristics of detected chemical compounds, the Arochembase V4 HERACLES V12 library, an HS100 autosampler, a set of independent chromatographic columns with different polarity (non-polar MXT-5 and medium polar MXT-1701, length 10 m). For the autosampler, the incubation time was set at 1200 s, the incubation temperature at 40 °C and the syringe temperature at 100 °C. About 2.5 ml of the sample were dispensed for 5 s at the dispenser temperature of 200 °C with the volumetric intensity of the carrier gas flow equal to 30 ml/min. The sample was kept at the sorption trap for 20 s at 40 °C. The analysis started at 40 °C for 2 s, and next, an increase in the temperature of 3 °C/s was used until a temperature of 270 °C was reached, which was maintained for 18 s. Hydrogen was used as the carrier gas. The following chemometric methods were used for proper data interpretation: PCA—Principal Component Analysis, DFA—Discriminant Function Analysis, SIMCA classification (SIMCA—Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogies) and SQC—Statistical Quality Control.\nChemometric Methods # The PCA is mainly used for modeling, compressing and the visualization of multivariate data. This method of data analysis involves the reduction of the number of variables describing samples or finding relationships between them. This method of data analysis presents the variability in the data structure transforming it into a new system of coordinates, where the number of coordinates will be less than the number of original variables. Transformations of variables are based on the fact that a new set of variables is created by a fewer variables, but at the same time a maximum variability of the dataset is achieved. After transformation, coordinates are called the principal components (Mazerski 2000).\nThe principle of DFA is to determine which variables allow to differentiate the samples into indicated groups. Subsequently, these variables are used to classify the unknown samples. This method comprises two main steps, namely first step—a step of learning or building a model, which relies on finding classification rules based on a training set of data, and second one—a classification step or the use of a model which is based on the classification rules obtained in first step (Mazerski 2000).\nThe SIMCA analysis is based on PCA models which are created for all the objects in the first stage of the analysis. Subsequently, each of class is calculated using a separate PCA model, which contains the optimum number of the main components defining the data structure. Classification is carried out in two stages. The second stage is called the stage of testing. It is based on the assignation of new objects to existing class with the best fit. The results of the classification depend on the choice of the number of principal components of model class (Wójcicki 2013).\nThe SQC analysis is usually used for quality control of processes. Samples, which belong to one group, should be related to the designated area of the graph. These parameters include deviations from the target samples or concentrations of tested substances. If unknown samples are not related to the designated area, it means they are statistically different with the samples assigned to the reference group (Karkalousos and Evangelopoulos 2011).\nResults and Discussion # All samples were first analysed using PCA to verify the usefulness of this method for distinguishing between distillates according to their botanical origin. This analysis allows data visualisations, owing to which it can be defined which samples differ the most from those found in the created group.\nPCA did not allow full differentiation between the tested distillates according to their botanical origin (Fig. 1). Two points belonging to one sample of a wheat distillate situated between PC1 = 25,000 and 50,000 overlapped with a group of points belonging to distillates produced from triticale situated between PC1 = 0 and 100,000. It is probably caused by smaller differences in the composition of wheat distillates and those produced from triticale, which is connected with the fact that triticale is a hybrid of wheat and rye. It should be noticed that the points are not dense in any of the tested groups. This is probably connected with various production processes of the tested distillates and the use of various cultivars for their production. Due to the lack of full differentiation, it is necessary to use another chemometric method to distinguish between agricultural distillates according to the tested materials.\nFig. 1 figure1 Fig. 1 PCA scores of agricultural distillates Full size image\nDFA was another method used—this analysis is used for grouping data and differentiating between groups.\nFigures 2 and 3 present DFA graphs. DFA allowed for distinguishing between all tested groups of agricultural distillates. Points belonging to wheat distillates are situated between DF1 = −17 and −10 on the DFA graph, while the points belonging to others groups are situated between DF1 = −1 and 4. Group of points belonging to triticale distillates are situated between DF1 = 0 and 10, DF2 = 5 and 12.5, DF3 = 0 and 6, group of points belonging to maize distillates are situated between DF1 = −5 and 10, DF2 = 7.5 and 12.5, DF3 = −6 and 0, which is shown on the 3D graph (Fig. 3). These groups are the closest to each other on the DFA graph. Due to small distances between points on the DFA graph, it was necessary to check other available chemometric methods.\nFig. 2 figure2 DFA scores of agricultural distillates Full size image\nFig. 3 figure3 Three-dimensional DFA scores of agricultural distillates Full size image\nIn SIMCA classification, a separate graph is created for each reference group. Groups are created on the basis of the principal component method. Next, the so-called “confidentiality envelope” is created around them, which should include, with defined probability, all elements contained in a given class. Four graphs were prepared for each group of distillates as a reference group.\nIt can be noticed in graphs presented in Figs. 4, 5, 6 and 7 that the so-called “confidentiality envelopes” contain only points, which belong to reference groups, i.e. groups, for which a given graph was created. All points belonging to other groups are outside the designated area. This means that the selected method proved to be successful in the differentiation between the tested groups of agricultural distillates.\nFig. 4 figure4 SIMCA scores of agricultural distillates; agricultural distillates from rye—a reference group Full size image\nFig. 5 figure5 SIMCA scores of agricultural distillates; agricultural distillates from maize—a reference group Full size image\nFig. 6 figure6 SIMCA scores of agricultural distillates; agricultural distillates from triticale—a reference group Full size image\nFig. 7 figure7 SIMCA scores of agricultural distillates; agricultural distillates from wheat—a reference group Full size image\nThe SQC analysis allowed for distinguishing only one group of points belonging to rye distillates. The other groups of points were characterised by too great differences between points belonging to individual groups. This is probably connected with different production processes and the use of various cultivars of the cereal in question. Apparently, rye cultivars used for the production of rye distillates are characterised by high similarity, as a result of which points belonging to rye distillates on the SQC graph overlap at close distances from each other (Fig. 8).\nFig. 8 figure8 SQC scores of agricultural distillates; agricultural distillates from rye—a reference group Full size image\nConclusion # Due to changing legal regulations, it is more and more often required that the materials needed for the production of alcohols obtained from agricultural distillates should be specified. To meet the demand, the usefulness of the electronic nose using ultra-fast gas chromatography for the assessment of the botanical origin of agricultural distillates was tested. This device is characterised by simplicity and the ability to conduct quick analyses, which last several dozen or several hundred seconds. Four chemometric methods were used for data analysis: PCA, DFA, SIMCA and SQC. From these methods, DFA and SIMCA allowed the differentiation between all tested groups of agricultural distillates. In PCA, the differentiation between distillates produced from triticale and those produced from wheat proved to be impossible. The SQC analysis, on the other hand, only allowed differentiation between rye distillates and the other distillates used in the analysis. In summary, the use of the electronic nose with ultra-fast gas chromatography and the use of chemometric DFA and SIMCA analyses allowed differentiation between agricultural distillates according to their botanical origin. The results of this study can be used for quality control and authentication in the food industry. The elaborated procedure allows to control the raw material delivered to the distilleries and consequently to reduce the adulteration of products appearing on the market. Moreover, the information about of the origin of these alcohols is achievable, thus the certification in accordance with legal regulations for such alcohols as Polish Vodkas will be also possible.\nReferences # Biernacka P, Wardencki W (2012) Volatile composition of raw spirits of different botanical origin.

Most religions declare certain food items fit and others unfit for human consumption. Dietary rules and regulations may govern particular phases of the human life cycle and may be associated with special events such as menstrual period, pregnancy, childbirth, lactation, and – in traditional societies – preparation for the hunt, battle, wedding, funeral, etc. On a comparative basis many food taboos seem to make no sense at all, as to what may be declared unfit by one group may be perfectly acceptable to another. On the other hand, food taboos have a long history and one ought to expect a sound explanation for the existence (and persistence) of certain dietary customs in a given culture. Yet, this is a highly debated view and no single theory may explain why people employ special food taboos. This paper wants to revive interest in food taboo research and attempts a functionalist\u0026rsquo;s explanation. However, to illustrate some of the complexity of possible reasons for food taboo five examples have been chosen, namely traditional food taboos in orthodox Jewish and Hindu societies as well as reports on aspects of dietary restrictions in communities with traditional lifestyles of Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, and Nigeria. An ecological or medical background is apparent for many, including some that are seen as religious or spiritual in origin. On the one hand food taboos can help utilizing a resource more efficiently; on the other food taboos can lead to the protection of a resource. Food taboos, whether scientifically correct or not, are often meant to protect the human individual and the observation, for example, that certain allergies and depression are associated with each other could have led to declaring food items taboo that were identified as causal agents for the allergies. Moreover, any food taboo, acknowledged by a particular group of people as part of its ways, aids in the cohesion of this group, helps that particular group maintain its identity in the face of others, and therefore creates a feeling of \u0026ldquo;belonging\u0026rdquo;.\nBackground # Years ago a student asked me the following question: \u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t all animals eat the same kinds of food?\u0026rdquo; This may have sounded a stupid question, but it is not as trivial an enquiry as one might have thought initially. Afterall, to grow and survive, animals all need the same basic things: carbohydrates, protein, fats, some minerals and water.\u0026quot; So, why do we have this diversity of food specialists on Earth? Why are there herbivores, carnivores, detritovores, insectivores, fungivores, coprophages, xylophages and many more?\nAlthough it is true that all heterotrophic organisms need the same fundamental food stuffs, it is easy to understand that on account of their different sizes, different anatomies, and different habitats, different species must make use of different food sources to satisfy their needs. A cat would happily devour the meat of an antelope and a lion would not reject a mouse, but both are not built for these kinds of food items. A tree-dwelling leaf-eater does not graze on the ground and a grazer does not climb trees. Pond snails may love lettuce, but they can never leave their watery realm. Moreover, it is a \u0026ldquo;Law of Nature\u0026rdquo; that, where there is an underexploited resource, it usually does not take long before such a resource is \u0026lsquo;discovered\u0026rsquo; and used by some organism. Yet, intense competition for one and the same kind of food by two species ultimately would lead to the extinction of one of them or it would result in the two species occupying different niches, either in connection with the food itself or the timing of feeding [1, 2].\nPage 1 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)\nIt is, thus, easy to understand why different species of animals with different anatomies and habitat preferences should use different food items, but food specialists within a species also occur and it is then less obvious why individuals of one and the same species should exploit different resources. It becomes really tricky, when some adults of the same gender, species, and overall physical built nevertheless vary in relation to their food preferences. Intraspecific competition may be involved, differences in hunting and/or collecting skills and strategies, acquired through learning or chance discovery, could be the reason, and there could even be an outwardly not visible physiological basis for such kinds of behaviour. Yet, no ecologist or zoologist would use the term \u0026ldquo;food taboo\u0026rdquo; to describe intraspecific food preferences of this kind in animals, but in connection with humans we do use the term \u0026ldquo;food taboo\u0026rdquo;. We use it (or refer to \u0026ldquo;prohibitions\u0026rdquo;) to distinguish the deliberate avoidance of a food item for reasons other than simple dislike from food preferences. In non-human mammals, dominant individuals may force weaker ones to accept less sought-after food items, and a possible liking for these originally reluctantly accepted food items may in turn develop [2, 3]. Some aspect of this scenario may also apply to human societies, because food taboos can be imposed on individuals by outsiders, or by members of the kinship group to manifest themselves through instruction and example during upbringing [4].\nProbably food taboos (as unwritten social rules) exist in one form or another in every society on Earth, for it is a fact that perhaps nowhere in the world, a people, a tribe, or an ethnic group, makes use of the full potential of edible items in its surroundings [5–10]. One of many examples, although an especially well-studied one, involves the Ache people, i.e., hunters and gatherers of the Paraguayan jungle. According to Hill and Hurtado [6], the tropical forests of the Ache habitat abound with several hundreds of edible mammalian, avian, reptilian, amphibian and piscine species, yet the Ache exploit only 50 of them. Turning to the plants, fruits, and insects the situation is no different, because only 40 of them are exploited. Ninety eight percent of the calories in the diet of the Ache are supplied by only seventeen different food sources.\nAlthough mere avoidance of potential food (for whatever reason) does not in itself signify a food taboo, it is easy to see how regular avoidance can turn into a tradition and eventually end up as a food taboo [7, 8, 10]. But what is it that leads to the regular avoidance? Social anthropological research on eating and food taboos (cf., reviews [7–11]) has frequently invoked utilitarian [7–9] and magico-religious motives [10] or seen the dichotomy between positive and negative rites as a basis for food taboos [11, 12]. A functionalist\u0026rsquo;s explanation of food taboos as mechanisms for conserving resources as well as a person\u0026rsquo;s health, have been less popular (cf., [13]), although there is good evidence in support of both [14–19]. Yet even rituals and taboos based on spiritual, religious, and magic ideation must have had a \u0026ldquo;history\u0026rdquo; and somehow \u0026lsquo;got going\u0026rsquo; [7–11, 20–23]. Therefore, given that food taboos can involve plants as well as animals, solids as well as liquids, hot as well as cold categories, wet and dry items, etc. [7–9, 12–15], this review, rather than attempting to provide a complete list of food taboos operating in human societies, will instead present examples of food taboos in selected human groups that illustrate some of the wide spectrum of food taboo origins. The five examples chosen reflect the author\u0026rsquo;s own cultural background (Jewish dietary laws), or are based on original field research by the author in Central Australia, Papua New Guinea, and India, or refer to other persons\u0026rsquo; published work (e.g., food taboos of the Orang Asli by [24]).\nMethods # Based on the authors own experience, observations, recordings, and interactions with locals, examples of Jewish dietary laws and Hindu practices form the basis of examples 4 and 5. Research stays in India of 2 months (Meghalaya and Nagaland) and three weeks (Karnataka and Goa) during sabbaticals in 1990 and 2005 as well as a Brahmin Indian wife further helped gathering the necessary information for the section on Hindu food taboos.\nField work by the author in Papua Niugini of several weeks each in 1972 (Onabasulu and neighbouring tribes), 1998, 2002, and 2004 (Kiriwina), during which the author stayed with the locals in their villages or homesteads and then studied the locals\u0026rsquo; entomophagic practices as well as food taboos, forms the basis for the information given in example 2. Information in the field was always gathered from more than one informant (although it has to be mentioned that the informants were all males). Examples 1 and 3 (Orang Asli and Mid-West Nigerian food taboos) were chosen from the literature available, because they illustrated yet other aspects and reasons for food taboos, not covered in the earlier mentioned examples. Thus, the selection of the examples represents a mixture between emic experiences from within a culture and etic approaches, i.e., results of field work amongst cultures other than the author\u0026rsquo;s own and research carried out by additional investigators on yet further cultural entities. The reason for the selection of the examples was twofold: to demonstrate the existence of very different possible food taboo reasons and to re-ignite interest in this important field of inter-disciplinary research.\nPage 2 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)\nResults # Example 1: The Orang Asli food taboos # The term \u0026lsquo;Orang Asli\u0026rsquo; describes a variety of aboriginal tribes, nowadays confined to the forests and forest fringes of West Malaysia. Food taboos amongst these people have been recorded by Bolton [24]. In the context of this review, the Orang Asli were chosen as an example of a people, in which food taboos appear to serve a double-purpose: the spiritual well-being of individuals and resource partitioning.\nHuman flesh is never eaten and animals, which the Orang Asli have kept as pets or have reared, are also protected. They can be sold, though, or given away to others, who then would have no qualms of consuming them. An animal that is capable of feeding on a human being will not be eaten as it conceivably could contain some \u0026ldquo;humanness\u0026rdquo; in it.\nSmall lizards and leeches are considered to be unclean to the jungle Orang Asli. Should a leech, for example, accidentally drop into the cooking pot, all its contents will be regarded as contaminated and thrown away. Poisonous and harmful animals are also taboo, but the dangers that result from eating certain species are frequently less real or physiological than spiritual/psychological. Thus, the crow is thought to be poisonous and is rarely eaten. Likewise, any small, crawling animal living in or on the soil, is usually left alone for fear it might be dangerous.\nSince all animals are considered to possess spirits, many Orang Asli will start their weaned children of more than 4 years of age on small animals: fish, frogs, toads, small birds and water snails. When the child gets a bit older, rats and mice can be added to the list of edible species.\nAt 20 years of age the human spirit is deemed to be strong enough to successfully compete with the spirits of small monkeys, bat species, cats, anteaters, deer, turtle, larger birds, and even the Malayan bear. Later in age snakes, gibbons, and bigger animals, including the elephant, no longer remain taboo.\nPregnant women have strict food taboos to observe and must restrict themselves to rats, squirrels, frogs, toads, smaller birds and fishes, that is animals which are small and thought to possess \u0026ldquo;weak\u0026rdquo; spirits. Moreover, rodents may be eaten only if caught by the pregnant woman\u0026rsquo;s husband or a near relative and she must eat the whole rodent by herself. Fish must also be caught by a near relative (but never with a spear or with the help of explosives).\nAfter childbirth, the mother normally eats gruel for a week and for 6 weeks thereafter has to eat on her own. She continues to observe food taboos, but her husband, who observed the same food restrictions as his pregnant wife, is then no longer bound by them. Special 6-day food taboos may be \u0026ldquo;prescribed\u0026rdquo; by a medicine man for any sick person that seeks his advice.\nAlthough the food taboos of the Orang Asli are not totally absolute, men are always ready to remind the younger women and children of the dangers of breaking them and of eating meat of new and unfamiliar species.\nExample 2: Food taboos of Papua New Guinea tribals # In Papua New Guinea (\u0026lsquo;Niugini\u0026quot; in Pidgin-English) with her multitude of peoples and cultures, food taboos are particularly varied. The example chosen illustrate that many food taboos are designed to protect humans from health hazards real and assumed. Yet, a tendency by some section of the society to safeguard exclusive rights to certain food items is also obvious.\nOnabasulu and neighbouring tribes with institutionalized homosexuality, like the Kaluli and others, regard with great suspicion any organism that lives or burrows in the soil [25]. Even harmless earthworms are detested. Illnesses are thought to frequently stem from the wrong food intake: stomach ache sufferers must avoid juicy fruits, such as watermelons, pawpaw, cabbage and the introduced pineapple.\nWomen are thought to be permanently in this \u0026lsquo;sickly\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;runny\u0026rsquo; state, because of recurring menstruations and are not allowed fresh meat, juicy bananas and all fruits of the forest of red colour. If a menstruating woman eats a fresh animal caught in a trap, it is thought that future traps will not fall; if the animal was caught with a dog, it is feared that the dog will lose its ability to find scent. Similarly, bananas and pandanus: if a menstruating woman happens to eat some of these fruits, it is believed that the trees will then cease to bear. A woman herself must leave the communal longhouse and move to a shack some distance away for the duration of her period. If she should cook or step over food, those who eat it, particularly her husband, will become \u0026ldquo;ill with cough and possibly die\u0026rdquo; [26]. Mature women must not eat fish and when pregnant are not even permitted eggs. Young unmarried men receive the best food and have to obey the smallest number of food taboos. When married, they, like their wives, can no longer eat fresh, but only smoked meat.\nPage 3 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)\nIn the Kiriwina (Trobriand) Islanders, pregnant women, too, have a considerable amount of food taboos to observe: fishes that lead a cryptic life or like to attach themselves to corals are not to be eaten by a pregnant woman, because this might cause her to have a complicated birth. Similar beliefs are attached to bananas, pawpaws, mango, and other fruits; they are thought to either cause a hydrocephalus, club-foot, distorted belly or give rise to other deformities in the newborn [27, 28].\nIn addition to these food taboos, different ones, affecting men, also exist. If the men intend to go fishing for sharks, they not only have to abstain from sexual intercourse for a while, but they also have to fast (posuma) and drink a large quantity of saltwater beforehand. Flatfish, including soles and stingrays, as well as a considerable number of other species of fish are taboo, and during the turtle season no garden work is to be carried out.\nFood unfit for human consumption in one village because of taboos, may, however, be traded for the permitted item from others, who observe other taboos. For example, the socially excluded inhabitants of the village of Boitalu are the only people on the Kiriwina Islands that can eat wild pig and wallaby (a small species of kangaroo).\nParticularly strict taboos govern what chiefs are permitted to eat. In the northern part of Kiriwina they may eat only fried or roasted things, stewed and boiled food being banned. In the south, however, the village chiefs are the only ones allowed to violate against the flatfish and stingray taboo.\nExample 3: Food taboos in Mid-West Nigeria # The continent of Africa, because of its size, presents an enormous variety of food taboos. In many parts fresh milk is avoided by adults, although for the Masai, Fulbe, Nuba and other East African groups this commodity is thought to represent a particularly wholesome food for young men and warriors [29]. Observations on food taboos of the inhabitants of mid-west Nigeria were chosen as they represent a particularly good example of a people, in which food taboos appear to have been imposed on society mainly to serve the interests of the \u0026lsquo;strongest\u0026rsquo; section, i.e., the reification of social hegemonies of the society: in particular the menfolk [30].\nIn the mid-west state of Nigeria, meat and eggs are not usually given to children, because parents believe it will make the children steal [30]. Gizzards and thighs of ducks are eaten by the elderly; children can only have the lower legs or sometimes the head. Frequently coconut milk and liver is taboo for children, because it is believed that \u0026ldquo;the milk renders them unintelligent, whereas the liver causes abscesses in their lungs\u0026rdquo; [30].\nIn some parts of Ishan, Afemai, and Isoko Divisions pregnant women avoid snails, whereas pregnant women of the Asaba Division are neither allowed to eat eggs nor drink milk, \u0026ldquo;because it is feared the children may develop bad habits after birth\u0026rdquo; [30]. Woen tribals of the Ika Division are forbidden to consume porcupine as that is thought to cause a delay in labour. Interestingly, the opposite (an easy delivery) is expected from some pregnant Urhobo women, who have consumed food leftovers from a rat. Following delivery, young mothers in parts of Benin and Ishan Divisions must not consume oil or fresh meat and in parts of Ishan, palmnut soup is forbidden for 30 days postpartum.\nMen have fewer food taboos to observe, but nevertheless some also exist. Snail consumption may weaken a warrior\u0026rsquo;s strength and to kill and eat some legendary animals that have helped a particular tribe in the past during intertribal warfare is totally forbidden. Thus, in some areas the partridge or bush fowl is not eaten; in others it is some water reptile or the porcupine or even the sheep that are protected by the food taboo. Beans are one of the plant species that are not eaten, because they are believed to cause stomach disorders.\nExample 4: The Hindu food taboos # The Hindu food taboos were chosen as example nr. 4 to illustrate how, in this case, the spiritual aspect dominates all food taboos. The concept of re-incarnation and the sanctity of life lies at the root of these food taboos, but resource conservation and safe-guarding health play a role as well.\nIn the Vedic Hindu Society there is a subdivision into 4 castes on the basis of labour: Brahmin (priestly), Kshatriya (defence), Vaisya (agriculture and business), and Shudra (menial labour). Lord Krishna compared the community to a human body, in which the Brahmin caste represents the head, and the others the arms, legs and bowels. Brahmins never handle any meat, fish, or eggs let alone eat any of these foods. A Brahmin cannot even imagine bringing such foods into the house. Furthermore, many orthodox Brahmins abstain from cooking or eating onion and garlic as they are said to increase passions like anger and sex drive. Milk and milk products are consumed, but said to be very sacred as the cow is held in the highest regard as \u0026ldquo;a holy mother\u0026rdquo;.\nAlthough the people belonging to the three other castes sometimes partake in fish, eggs, and even meats (normally only chicken, goat, or mutton), these are never to be cooked or eaten during religious occasions, marriages, times of mourning, breaking religious fasts, pilgrimages, and similar times. Certain special religious festival days (as well as Mahatma Gandhi\u0026rsquo;s Day) are declared by the Indian Government as \u0026ldquo;Meatless Days\u0026rdquo; when no meat is sold anywhere. In castes, in which meat-eating does occur, widows are tabooed from eating meat, fish, or eggs so as to keep their passions low. On the l1th day after New Moon and Full Moon (Ekadasi) many Hindus abstain from eating grain, which otherwise is their staple food. Pregnant women are restricted from eating pawpaw and jackfruit as substances in these fruits are feared to have abortive influences.\nPage 4 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)\nDuring any religious ceremony (and for a Brahmin, every day is governed by strict religious schedules) the offering of food to the gods always precedes food intake. Food, thus, becomes sanctified and is called \u0026lsquo;Prasad\u0026rsquo; (i.e., God\u0026rsquo;s Mercy), which is then partaken. This practice follows from the ancient scripture \u0026ldquo;Bhagavad Gita\u0026rdquo; [31], in which the Lord says: \u0026ldquo;If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit, or water, I will accept it\u0026rdquo; (Text 26) and \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away as well as austerities that you may perform, should be done as an offering unto Me\u0026rdquo; (Text 27). \u0026ldquo;In this way you will be freed from all reactions to good and evil deeds and by this principle of renunciation you will be liberated and come to Me\u0026rdquo; [31].\nHindus do believe that plants also have life, though in a more sedate and sedentary form. The use of plants as food is considered less sinful than taking the lives of animals, but they must not be broken or harvested after dark. The saying \u0026ldquo;You are what you eat\u0026rdquo; is explicitly mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita (Chapter 17: [31]): \u0026ldquo;Foods in the mode of goodness increase the duration of life, purify one\u0026rsquo;s existence and give strength, health, happiness and satisfaction. Such nourishing foods are sweet, juicy, fattening, and palatable. Foods that are too bitter, too sour, salty and pungent, dry and hot, are liked by people in the modes of passion. Such foods cause pain, distress, and disease. Food cooked more than three hours before being eaten, which is tasteless, stale, putrid, decomposed and unclean, is food liked by people in the mode of ignorance\u0026rdquo;. Thus, although this powerful message does not contain precise instructions to \u0026ldquo;do\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;not to do\u0026rdquo;, it describes the effects of different kinds of food and leaves the final choice to the individual. The non-selected foods may therefore be declared food taboos by society.\nThe Situation with regard to liquids is fairly similar. Intoxicants are plainly said to put a person\u0026rsquo;s mind off the natural course and, hence, puts the person into more passion and ignorance. Alcohol and narcotics are, therefore, forbidden and will not enter the household of a traditional Hindu family.\nExample 5: The Jewish dietary laws # Jewish dietary laws, containing some of the sentiments found also in the Hindu food taboos, have been chosen to illustrate how food taboos with origins steeped in religion, promotion of health, and protection of life combine to create a set of rules that foremost and for all unite a people and create group-cohesion.\nOn the day of the Atonement (Yom Kippur) no Jew will eat or drink anything for 24 hours (and on the ninth of the month of \u0026lsquo;Av\u0026rsquo; many will fast again). During the first nine days of the month of \u0026lsquo;Av\u0026rsquo;, as an expression of mourning, no meat whatsoever is eaten. On Pessah (Passover) nothing that is leavened (in other words ordinary bread) is consumed or enters a Jewish home.\nCertain kinds of food have become associated with particular seasons or festivals: the matzah has become the bread of affliction on Pessah; \u0026lsquo;gefillte fish\u0026rsquo; is a common dish on the Shabbat eve; a Rosh Hashanah (the Jewish New Year) without apples and honey is impossible to imagine, and hamantaschen and kreplach are foods symbolical of the feast of Purim [32]. Yet, all through the year a Jew is conscious of his/her Jewishness through complex dietary laws, collectively termed \u0026lsquo;kashrut\u0026rsquo;. Milk or milk-products (i.e., \u0026lsquo;Milchiges\u0026rsquo; in Yiddish) must never be consumed together with meat (i.e., \u0026lsquo;Fleischiges\u0026rsquo; in Yiddish). Plates, pots, cutlery, and other utensils used in connection with meat-containing foods must be kept separate at all times from those used with other foods.\nTo be classified as permitted (i.e., kosher), an animal must both chew the cud and have a cloven hoof, birds have to have wings, and aquatic organisms must possess both fins and scales [33]. Shrimps, oysters, lobsters, creatures that creep on the ground, reptiles and worms found in fruits or vegetables are all prohibited. To ingest blood of any animal is strictly forbidden, and to be fit for consumption \u0026ldquo;beast and fowl must be slaughtered according to the law and if they are not of a domesticated species their blood must be covered with earth after slaughter\u0026rdquo; [34].\nAn animal that has died naturally is considered unfit for consumption as is a torn or mauled animal. Also prohibited is the sinew of the thigh (gid hanasheh) of any animal. The only permitted way of slaughter is with \u0026ldquo;an exceedingly sharp knife without the slightest notch so as to make the taking of a life as painless a procedure as possible\u0026rdquo; [35]. Slaughtering an animal and its young on the same day is prohibited and there is also a requirement to release a parent bird before taking the chicks [36]. As one of the seven Noachidic Laws, the prohibition to eat flesh of a living animal applies to Jew and non-Jew alike. The rabbinical attitude towards hunting animals for pleasure is entirely negative [35].\nPage 5 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)\nInterpreting the biblical record, mankind was not allowed to eat any meat at all until after \u0026ldquo;the Flood\u0026rdquo;, although as part of the holy sacrifice of animals to God the consumption of kosher meat had been allowed [37, 38]. Later, when the entire Jewish people became considered a \u0026ldquo;kingdom of priests\u0026rdquo;, the priestly rules in relation to the consumption of \u0026ldquo;clean\u0026rdquo; (kosher) meat were extended to the whole community. Even then, only special persons can actually take an animal\u0026rsquo;s life. It has to be a \u0026lsquo;Shohet\u0026rsquo;, the Jewish ritual slaughterer, whose appointment depends on the possession of a rabbinical certificate, and on Shabbat or other holy days no killing can take place.\nNot always are the dietary laws clear and explicit and there is often room for interpretation, especially with regard to insects as food. Popularly considered \u0026rsquo;trefah\u0026rsquo; (unfit for human consumption) locusts and scale insects are an exception and some Jewish scholars firmly believe that in the passage [33] \u0026ldquo;examine beast, fowl, locusts, and fish to determine whether they are permitted\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, the term locusts stands for insects generally, while others apply it to just four species of locusts. Jewish dietary laws apply to everyone in the community, so that no exceptions for children, women or old folk are permitted, as long as a human life is not endangered. The protection of human life, however, overrides all dietary discipline and for priests and dealings with priests additional dietary rules apply.\nChristian \u0026lsquo;Seventh Day Adventists\u0026rsquo; have adopted many of the Jewish/Biblical dietary laws, but while to the Jew there is a place for wine, coffee, and tea (at least for those old enough to have been given complete religious responsibility), Seventh Day Adventists declare all intoxicating and addictive drinks prohibited. Gluttony and drunkenness are, of course, also forbidden to Jews.\nDiscussion # General remarks # Different workers have different opinions on what constitutes a \u0026ldquo;food taboo\u0026rdquo;. Generally speaking, a taboo prohibits someone from doing something, e.g., \u0026ldquo;touching a sacred person, killing a certain animal, eating certain food, eating at certain times\u0026rdquo; [39]. Taboos represent \u0026ldquo;unwritten social rules that regulate human behaviour\u0026rdquo; [14] and define the \u0026ldquo;in-group\u0026rdquo; [20]. According to Barfield [40] there may be as many as 300 reasons for particular avoidances (amongst them not wanting to look like a food item, special place of food item in myth or history, food item perceived as dirty, predatory, humanlike etc.), which can magnify effects of seasonal or other restrictions on nutritional intake and may put women at nutritional risk during critical periods in their reproductive cycle.\nIf the avoidance of a certain food item provides the food avoider with an immediate result, for instance absence of an allergic reaction, we can assign a proximate cause to the food item in question. However, if the consequences of a food taboo are not immediately visible and may take months, years, or even generations to manifest themselves, we have to speak of ultimate causes. For researchers of food taboos, the often unsurmountable difficulty is that proximate and ultimate causes of food taboos may overlap [17] and, in fact, cannot always be separated.\nIt can be seen from these remarks that a discussion of food taboos is possible in a variety of ways with a variety of foci. By using the examples given above in this paper, the author wishes to highlight certain reasons, which seem to have been involved in the establishment of food taboos in those cultures examined (but may have been at the root of food taboos in other cultures as well). Discussing the examples in this way, a kind of classification results that might well be generally applicable to societies (not part of this investigation), in which food taboos exist.\nFood taboos for certain members of the society and to highlight special events # Any interpretation of food taboos has to consider the region they operate in, the era or circumstances they came into existence, or, in other words, the food history of a people [7, 8, 41, 42]. Desert locusts, having been common and sustained ancient Israelites in a dry land, are not taboo, but why should other insects be taboo? Rational explanations are not always possible and what to one group is strictly taboo, to another may be perfectly acceptable [43]. Some food taboos evolved in connection with attempts to steer or control man\u0026rsquo;s destiny [44] and attempts to put some \u0026ldquo;order\u0026rdquo; into the occurrence of and reason(s) behind food taboos must realize that food taboo categories are not clear-cut. Food taboos, based on religious beliefs for example, may have a health-related root and taboos restricting certain foods to men may be an expression of male dominance or differences in skills between the sexes.\nTaking a look at the ubiquity of food taboos, we notice that sometimes taboos affect all sections of the population at all times: Jewish dietary laws [45] and the basic Hindu regulation of \u0026ldquo;no meat, no fish, no eggs\u0026rdquo; are cases in point. Occasionally, ubiquitous food taboos become suspended or are enforced periodically as with the Friday for the Catholic Christians, when no meat but fish only is to be consumed and the pre-Easter weeks of lent, when meat of warm-blooded animals should not be eaten. The annual Yom Kippur with its total ban of food and liquid intake as a periodical food taboo event (cf., definition of the word taboo [39]) also comes to mind, but this total stop of food and liquid intake is a special case.\nPage 6 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)\nFrequently, food taboos affect males or females, leaders or subjects, children or widows and widowers differently; in other words they are distributed unevenly. Food taboos, as we have seen in the examples of the Orang Asli in Malaysia [24], mid-west state Nigerians [30], or parts of the Congo [46], may change throughout a person\u0026rsquo;s lifetime with age in a predictable manner, as accepted and expected by society.\nFood taboos frequently accompany \u0026lsquo;coming-of-age\u0026rsquo; or initiation ceremonies [47]; they can also be prescribed at times of drought, flooding or lunar and solar eclipses, and many more events. Thus, one of the aims of food taboos is to highlight particular happenings, making them memorable. In fact, the vast majority of all food taboos come under this group of \u0026ldquo;specific events\u0026rdquo; and one of its various sub-categories. Food taboos at menstruation, during and after pregnancies, on the sickbed in times of illness, in times of mourning, in preparation for a wedding, or before combat are commonly encountered [48]. Persons of Asian descent traditionally perceive health in connection with the bodily balance of \u0026lsquo;hot and cold\u0026rsquo; and, thus, when under the influence of disease or pregnancy, would avoid food items considered \u0026lsquo;hot\u0026rsquo;, which may even include iron tablets [49].\nFood taboos to protect human health # When a particular taboo is regarded as God-given, as a form of instruction or command from the \u0026ldquo;Supreme\u0026rdquo; and thus play a role in the cultural or religious belief system [14], then it is usually seen as part of a \u0026lsquo;package\u0026rsquo; to protect the believers, to safeguard them against evil [20–23]. To doubt, even to ask any questions about the reasons behind the taboo is seen as blasphemous. Likewise, in tribes with totem beliefs, it follows that it has to be taboo to eat the totem animal, as otherwise it could take revenge and adversely affect the whole tribe [42]. However, irrespective of the God-given rules or advice, people must have noticed changes in the behaviour of persons that consumed certain food items. Such behavioural and/or emotional consequences of certain foods must have been recognizable not only to the consumer of the food, but also to her/his company and could have been the origin of such seemingly God-given guidelines. For instance, food items involved in IgE-mediated allergies (like, for instance, shrimp: [50]) should have been easily identifiable and then could first have led to their avoidance and, secondly, to a total ban of them.\nEating to regulate emotions has been listed as one of the five classes of \u0026ldquo;emotion-induced changes of eating\u0026rdquo; by Macht [51] and IgE-mediated atopic diseases are known to be associated with depression [52] and suicide rate [53]. An increase of unsaturated fatty acids in the diet has been found to be correlated with decreased violent behaviour [54] and an exposure to sunflower seeds [55] and colorants derived from the fungus Monascus ruber [56] can cause asthma attacks. Finally, low glycaemic meals have been reported to improve memory and ability to sustain attention [57], features that might not have gone unnoticed by our forebears in earlier times and could have led to the avoidance or recommendation not to consume certain food items.\nAs scientists we are obliged to probe, to scrutinize, to question and although many food taboos do not appear to have a health-related, \u0026lsquo;rational\u0026rsquo; explanation, some clearly have become established, because of the aim to protect the health of an individual (and this would equally apply to Modena\u0026rsquo;s recently suggested \u0026ldquo;anti-taboo\u0026rdquo; concept in choosing food denominations: [58]). Taboos of the Hindu related to collecting fruits and breaking plants after sunset go back to times when no artificial lighting was available and, therefore, it must have been outright dangerous to pick fruits at night. Consequently, it would make perfect sense to taboo the collecting of fruit after dark. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, cramps, and maybe death, whether rightly or wrongly, were frequently considered to be some of the after-effects of ingesting certain foods [41].\nIn some cases the threat to a person\u0026rsquo;s health may be obvious and demonstrable with modern medical, chemical, and other analytical techniques, but of course it was not always like this. Amazon and coastal fishermen, for example, declare mostly carnivorous, especially piscivorous, fishes taboo: we know now that their place high in the food pyramid renders them particular rich in contaminants and toxins [17]. Alcohol, another example, is an addictive poison and as such is taboo for children of most societies. Snakes and other venomous or dangerous creatures had better be left alone as the risk of procuring them for food can outweigh their nutritional value. A utilitarian reason to despise swine, as it competes with humans for food and water in dry lands, has been put forward by Harris [7], but pork is taboo to many people, because pigs tend to harbour masses of sickness-causing parasites. Moreover, it is claimed that pig meat contains substances, which have been linked to high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, rheumatism, arthritis, boils, asthma and eczema. Apparently, soldiers fighting in North Africa during World War II began to increasingly suffer from toxic ulcera of the legs as long as there was pork in their diet. When their food was pork-free, the ulcera disappeared [59].\nFood taboos during pregnancy and food changes over the course of the menstrual cycle # Declaring certain foods taboo because they are thought to make a person sick, is also the basis for the many food taboos affecting pregnant women. Largely linked with the realms of mind and \u0026lsquo;psyche\u0026rsquo;, the taboos of not eating cryptic fish amongst the Trobriand Islanders or watermelon and other fruits amongst the Onabasulu are actually meant to protect the health of the pregnant woman and her offspring and thought to ease the process of birth-giving, even if modern nutritionists completely disagree. Likewise, the rule of the Orang Asli that young people can only cope with small animals like snails, mice and rats as food, because their spirits are also small and for that reason are not likely to do much harm to a small child\u0026rsquo;s spirit, is designed to protect human life.\nPage 7 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)\nYet, it is often pregnant and lactating women in various parts of the world that are forced to abstain from especially nutritious and beneficial foods (Mexico: [60]; Indonesia: [61]; Korea: Lee H.-I., pers. comm.). Although it is not clear why and how exactly these restrictions came to be accepted (see below), pregnant women do not always adhere to them. Amongst the Lese-women of the Ituri forest of Africa, women cope with these restrictions by either secretly discounting them or by eating prophylactic plants that supposedly prevent the consequences of eating the tabooed foods [62]. Flaunting taboos has also been reported by Alvard [63], who then suggested that food taboos would be of little value to nature conservation (but see the evidence to the contrary by Colding and Folke [14]).\nThe fact that women throughout the world (with few exceptions) display a slightly but significantly reduced calorific intake around the time of ovulation has been noted for a long time and formed the topic of a recent review by Fessler [64]. He used the term \u0026ldquo;periovulatory nadir\u0026rdquo; for the phenomenon and concluded that it was linked to increased locomotor activity, interest in wanderlust, \u0026ldquo;a desire to meet new people (particularly men)\u0026rdquo;. Regrettably, it is not known if specific food items are being avoided, perhaps even subconsciously, at the time of the periovulatory nadir.\nFood taboos as an ecological necessity to protect the resource # As hinted upon earlier and demonstrated in several studies, most notably [14–19], food taboos frequently seem to have an ecological background, which according to Harris [7] is based on utilitarian principles. On the one hand, they may lead to a fuller utilization of a resource and on the other they can lead to its protection. If North West American Inuit and Nootka Indians both hunt and eat the whale, it makes good ecological sense when the Tlingit Indians of the same region regard the giant sea mammal as taboo and look for food on land [65]. Some ecological consequence can also be ascribed to the custom amongst the Ka\u0026rsquo;aor Indians of the northern Maranhao (Brazil) of allowing only menstruating women, pubescent girls, and parents of newborns to consume the meat of tortoises [66] and the fact that amongst the indigenous people of Ratanakiri (Cambodia) different food taboos operate even between neighbouring villages [67]. Of 70 existing examples of species-specific taboos, identified and analysed by Colding and Folke [14], 30% were found to prohibit the use of species listed as threatened by the IUCN Red Data Book.\nIn the same vein, if women and children, as in the Orang Asli, eat only small animals while older people also consume bigger species, a measure like this would distribute ecological pressure more evenly across a greater number of consumable species. This can lead to a situation, in which females are only permitted plants and insects as food, while the menfolk are free to ingest meat, egg, and fish [7]. The regulations amongst the Canadian Netsilik [68] that sea-mammal and terrestrial mammal must never be eaten on the same day and amongst Jews that milk and milk-containing foods cannot be consumed together with meat, have an ecological ring. Clearly, sustainability of a resource is served by the taboo not to eat the young and its parent and by the Hindu custom of not totally finishing a plate, so that there is always some plant material left over for Nature (e.g., seeds). To safeguard a resource for a time of crisis may be the reason, why certain fishes of the Amazon are not normally eaten, but spared [69].\nFood taboos in order to monopolize a resource # Declaring a food item taboo for one section of the population, can of course, lead to a monopoly of the food in question by the remainder of the population [7]. For purely egoistic reasons men may declare meat and other, to them, delicacies taboo \u0026ldquo;for others\u0026rdquo;. That this is the main reason for some food taboos affecting mainly women and children, is suspected by [30]. Traditional healers in Nigeria sometimes attribute childhood ailments to breaking the food norms [70] and in Senegal women and children, but not men, must avoid poultry products. That this can lead to a shortage of adequate supplies of essential nutrients especially in the most vulnerable group of the rural population is self-understood [71].\nPage 8 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)\nThe fact that in many societies alcohol-drinking women are poorly respected (while for men alcohol consumption is regarded as normal), in essence, seems little different from the Australian aboriginal practice that native honey (a rare and sweet delicacy) is seen as something fit only for the old and wise men. Amongst the Bolivian Siriono, there are \u0026ldquo;hundreds of food taboos\u0026rdquo;, but they apply only very loosely to the elderly, who can break the taboos. This ensures their welfare and survival when no longer able to hunt for the \u0026lsquo;right food\u0026rsquo; [72].\nFood taboos as an expression of empathy # Empathy, i.e., feeling for and with the poor animal that is to have its life terminated for the selfish reason of devouring it, is yet another powerful reason for certain food taboos to have come into existence. In many societies, pet animals enjoy a greater degree of protection and are more likely to be given \u0026ldquo;taboo\u0026rdquo; status than individuals that are unfamiliar and \u0026ldquo;unrelated\u0026rdquo;. It is almost as if \u0026ldquo;humanness\u0026rdquo; rubs off and the pet becomes regarded as an \u0026ldquo;honorary human\u0026rdquo;.\nHindu religious thought with its belief of re-incarnation even goes a step further and basically does not distinguish between human and animal with regard to their souls – only the packaging is seen to differ. It follows that by eating an animal, a Hindu could indeed, to put it bluntly, be eating a deceased relative. And that -with few exceptions where endocannibalism was the accepted practice and parts of a human corpse were ritually consumed as in certain tribes of Papua Niugini- is almost everywhere a taboo [73–75].\nFood taboos as a factor in group-cohesion and group-identity # Finally, it ought to be mentioned that any food taboo, acknowledged by a particular group of people as part of its ways, aids in the cohesion of this group, helps that group stand out amongst others, assists that group to maintain its identity and creates a feeling of \u0026ldquo;belonging\u0026rdquo;. Thus, food taboos can strengthen the confidence of a group by functioning as a demonstration of the uniqueness of the group in the face of others.\nFood taboos and food habits can persist for a very long time and can be (and have been) made use of in identifying cultural and historical relationships between human populations [76, 77]. It has, for instance, been suggested that the food taboos of both Jews and Hindus reflect not the nutritional needs, but the explicit concerns of the pastoral peoples\u0026rsquo; that they once were [78].\nConclusion # In our increasingly international world, it is essential that we know and understand food taboos of societies other than and in addition to our own. In a world, in which many persons still go hungry, it is important to realize that numerous societies impose restrictions on what is acceptable as food and that in most cases the full food potential of a given environment is not being made use of. Food restrictions can affect the nutritional status of a community or a subsection within it. There may be sound reasons for prohibiting certain food items as we have demonstrated in this paper, but declaring some food items taboo can equally well be a form of suppression by a more dominant sector of the society. To explore the operating food taboos from historic, hygienic, and social perspectives must be the aim of any study that deals with the problem of community food culture [10, 14, 79, 80]. In the words of Drewnowski and Levine [80]: \u0026ldquo;There is a need for further discussions of the economics of food choice\u0026rdquo;.\nAuthor\u0026rsquo;s contributions # The single author of this paper (VBM-R) is responsible for every aspect of the research, the conclusions, and the writing of the paper.\nPage 9 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)\nReferences # May RM: Theoretical Ecology. 1981, Oxford, Blackwell Google Scholar Krebs CJ: Ecology. 2001, San Francisco, Benjamin Cummings, 5 Google Scholar Koehler J, Leonhaeuser IU: Changes in food preferences during aging.

More than 450 million people depend on the waters of Ganges for many aspects of their life. In 1896, one of the first published works on Ganges water by Ernst Hankin, a British bacteriologist demonstrated antibacterial property of Ganges water against Vibrio cholera [1]. Further work by French microbiologist D’Herelles in the beginning of the twentieth century established that the antibacterial property of Ganges water to be due to a factor, later named “bacteriophage” [2]. The above said studies were conducted during the period of Crown rule in India and a significant number of founding studies on Ganges were carried out mainly by British and French microbiologists. Such studies on Ganges led to the introduction of bacteriophages to the world. Bacteriophages are the prokaryotic viruses that solely infect and/or destroy the bacteria. Bacteriophages were associated with the special property of river Ganges [1, 2].\nInterestingly, our study for the first time has shown the presence of bacteriophages against putrefying and pathogenic bacteria in the waters of Ganges even at its origin (Fig. 1). The origin of river Ganges is known as Gomukh. Geological studies have proven that the Himalayas had emerged at a site where the Tethys Ocean once existed, as a result of collision between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. Hence, Himalayas’ marine origin is known and it has been intriguing to find marine fossils high in the Himalayas [3].\nFig. 1 figure1 Representative plate of phages isolated against bacteria—Escherichia spp. at Gomukh’s melting permafrost. Plaque assay—clear plaques due to bacteriophage mediated bacterial cell lysis are visible Full size image\nNotably, the physical property of water at the Gomukh is also unique, as observed during the sampling, loads of sediment gushes out in force along with water at this origin site which is due to the melting permafrost. Typically the Himalayan permafrost [4] melts and forms the origin of Ganges. We believe the bacteriophages trapped at a much earlier time scale in the Himalayan permafrost as abiotic particles are being released gradually with the melting permafrost, thereby making a seed source of bacteriophage at Gomukh. To the best of our knowledge this is the first ground breaking finding of its kind.\nA recent publication shows that 30,000 years old frozen giant virus was discovered deep in the Siberian Permafrost, was revived and still infectious [5]. Interestingly, another group has isolated a temperate bacteriophage from Antarctic Dry Valley environment against Psychrobacter—an extremophile and studied its genomic aspects [6]. The above stated findings literally encourage and prompt for further groundbreaking possibilities with exploring bacteriophages and its revival in the frozen Himalayan permafrost.\nReferences # Hankin EH.

Deliberate practice was the result of a search for characteristics of effective practice in the laboratory that was shown to improve expert professional performance in domains, such as music. In this reply, I will first describe five different criteria that defined the original concept of deliberate practice and each of them is presented with directly supporting quotes from Ericsson, Krampe, and Tesch-Römer (Psychol Rev 100:396–406, 10.1037/0033-295X.87.3.215, 1993) paper. Unfortunately, Macnamara, Hambrick, and Oswald (Psychol Sci 25:1608–1618, 10.1177/0956797614535810, 2014) misinterpreted our concept of deliberate practice, and defined it much more broadly: “as engagement in structured activities created specifically to improve performance in a domain” (p. 914). This definition led them to include activities, such as attending lectures, studying alone by students, and group activities led by a coach, where each activity does not meet one or more of our criteria for deliberate practice. In this commentary, I will argue that Macnamara and Hambrick (2020) became aware of some of the original criteria for deliberate practice, such as the role of individualized training by a teacher, and these discoveries misled them to assume that we had changed our definition. The intended meaning of sentences that Macnamara and Hambrick (2020) had carefully selected is shown to have an appropriate interpretation in Standard English that is consistent with our original definition of deliberate practice. In conclusion, I will give a proposal for how the different perspectives can be reconciled.\nIntroduction # In their commentary, Macnamara and Hambrick (2020) generously accepted the empirical findings and the central role of purposeful practice in attained SCRABBLE performance reported by Moxley, Ericsson, and Tuffiash (2017) but they criticized perceived contradictions in our definition of deliberate practice. They stated: “First and foremost, the authors have defined deliberate practice in flatly contradictory ways.” (p. 2).\nTo address their criticism, I will first document and describe our original definition of deliberate practice published in 1993 (Ericsson, Krampe, \u0026amp; Tesch-Römer, 1993) and how this type of practice differs from traditional conceptions of practice and accumulated experience by the simultaneous presence of five distinct characteristics. I will then compare this description to the definition that was used to include studies in their influential meta-analysis (Macnamara, 2014; Macnamara, Hambrick, \u0026amp; Oswald, 2014). I will show that what Macnamara and Hambrick (2020) claim to be inconsistencies and contradictions in our original definition of deliberate practice can be accounted for by an original misunderstanding of our definition and subsequent discoveries of differences between their incorrect definition and our original definition of deliberate practice. Once our field recognizes that these two definitions are distinctly different from each other and deserve unique names, I will propose how it should be possible to pursue research on expert performance in a cumulative manner.\nThe original definition of deliberate practice published in 1993 # The goal guiding Ericsson et al.’s (1993) original research was to search for effective training activities for attaining expert levels of performance in professional domains outside the laboratory. Ericsson et al. (1993) begin their paper by reviewing studies of effective learning in the laboratory conducted in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and found conditions, where large improvement of performance with practice was consistently found: “The most cited condition concerns the subjects\u0026rsquo; motivation to attend to the task and exert effort to improve their performance. In addition, the design of the task should take into account the preexisting knowledge of the learners so that the task can be correctly understood after a brief period of instruction. The subjects should receive immediate informative feedback and knowledge of results of their performance. The subjects should repeatedly perform the same or similar tasks” (Ericsson et al., 1993, p. 367).\nThe key features of these conditions for improving performance are:\nThe task must be well defined with a clear goal and be fully understood by the participant. The participants need to be able to perform the task by themselves The participants need to gain immediate informative and actionable feedback on each performance of the practice task that allow them to make appropriate adjustments to improve. The participant needs to be able to “repeatedly perform the same or similar tasks” Ericsson et al. (1993) go on to describe a fifth criterion:\nThe practice task must be designed and performed in accordance with individualized instruction and guidance of a teacher. “To assure effective learning, subjects ideally should be given explicit instructions about the best method and be supervised by a teacher to allow individualized diagnosis of errors, informative feedback, and remedial part training. The instructor has to organize the sequence of appropriate training tasks and monitor improvement to decide when transitions to more complex and challenging tasks are appropriate” (p. 367). These criteria were explicitly described in my immediate unpublished response (Ericsson 2014a) to Macnamara et al.’s (2014) meta-analysis and this response was explicitly cited by Hambrick, Macnamara, Campitelli, Ullén, and Mosing (2016). The criteria were also described in my published criticism (Ericsson, 2016), as well as in earlier studies to be discussed later in this reply.\nAfter a search for activities meeting the 5 criteria among domains of expertise with centuries of experience of successfully training individuals to attain reproducibly superior (expert) performance, Ericsson et al. (1993) focused on training at an international music academy, where teachers work individually with music students and state: “Throughout development toward expert performance, the teachers and coaches instruct the individuals to engage in practice activities that maximize improvement. Given the cost of individualized instruction, the teacher designs practice activities that the individual can engage in between meetings with the teacher. We call these practice activities deliberate practice” (p. 368, italics in the original).\nWhen a practice activity meets all of the five external conditions (criteria) we referred to it as deliberate practice. Ericsson et al. (1993) also discussed efforts to find practice activities in other domains that met only some, but not all of these conditions (criteria) in domains of expertise, such as chess, typing, and sports. Ericsson (2009) is rather explicit about the fact that only some criteria for deliberate practice are met for some activities: “It has been more difficult to isolate practice activities that meet all the criteria for deliberate practice.” (p. 419, italics added). Similarly, in the same edited volume, Ericsson et al. (2009) referred to “the amount and quality of solitary activities meeting the criteria of deliberate practice and performance in different domains of expertise” (p. 9, italics added), they intended to say “some of the criteria” and definitely not “all of the criteria”. I agree that this sentence would have removed any ambiguity if it had included “some of”, but Macnamara and Hambrick’s claim that it implicitly says “all of” is not accurate given that no reference to these criteria had been made earlier in this chapter, the use of the definite article, “the” has no known referent and, thus, can refer to any combinations of criteria for deliberate practice.\nThe central claim of Macnamara and Hambrick’s (2020, p. 4) commentary is that Moxley et al. (2017) “replace[d} the term ‘deliberate practice’ with ‘purposeful practice’”, when they described the same solitary practice with SCRABBLE reported by Tuffiash, Roring, \u0026amp; Ericsson (2007). A more careful reading shows that Tuffiash et al. (2007) identified some practice activities that met several of the criteria, but not all, for deliberate practice, which they described as “the quantity of time spent on SCRABBLE-related activities that best met the theoretical description of deliberate practice” (p. 131, emphasis added). Consequently, Moxley et al. (2017) did not change any definitions, but used the name, purposeful practice, for those practice activities that met the first four criteria, but not the fifth criterion involving individualized guidance by a qualified teacher.\nBefore discussing some of the other quoted sentences alleged to be inconsistent with our original definition of deliberate practice, I will propose one possible alternative explanation for why Macnamara and Hambrick (2020) perceived inconsistencies in our definition of deliberate practice.\nThe definition of practice adopted by Macnamara and Hambrick in 2014 # Macnamara et al.’s (2014) meta-analysis was the first joint publication by both Macnamara and Hambrick and the first joint paper with a proposed definition of “deliberate practice”. In this paper, Macnamara et al. (2014, p.1608) described their definition of this concept: “deliberate practice, which Ericsson et al. defined as engagement in structured activities created specifically to improve performance in a domain.” In their meta-analysis, “the first formal meta-analysis of the relationship between deliberate practice and human performance” (p. 1609), they report identifying 9331 potentially relevant studies and selecting 88 studies for inclusion. The only inclusion criterion directly referencing “deliberate practice” and it required that: “a measure of accumulated amount (e.g., number of hours) of one or more activities interpretable as deliberate practice (henceforth, deliberate practice) was collected, with reference in the study report to at least one publication on deliberate practice by Ericsson et al.” (Macnamara et al., 2014, p. 1610, bold added).\nTheir definition specifies that the practice activity needs to be structured, but that does not seem to rule out practice activities with the exception of play. The more informative part of that definition states that the activity has to be designed to improve performance, but does not specify by whom it was designed: the performers themselves or their teachers or coaches? In contrast, our definition of deliberate practice avoids these problems of ambiguity and is a conjunction of five criteria expressed in terms of standard concepts in psychology. These concepts are reasonably invariant across time, such as “explicit goals for improving performance”, “immediate feedback”, “opportunity to repeat”, and “guidance by teachers”, although further theoretical and empirical refinement in measurement of each of these concepts is both likely and desirable.\nTo distinguish their definition from ours in the following text, I will now refer to their definition of relevant practice activities, as structured practice. An examination of the practice activities that they included in their meta-analysis shows them to be consistent with their definition of structured practice because the activities are both structured as well as designed by somebody to improve performance. For example, they included a study where the structured practice involved attending lectures (Masui, Broeckmans, Doumen, Groenen, \u0026amp; Molenberghsm, 2012). This activity is clearly structured and led by a teacher. The lecture is designed by a teacher to improve the students’ performance. This activity, however, does not meet the criteria requiring individualized assessment of each students’ current performance and the individualized design of appropriate practice activities for each student, nor would the lecture typically include practice activities that can be repeatedly performed with clear goals and immediate actionable feedback. Other structured practice activities included in their meta-analysis involve watching games relevant to their sport on tv (Baker, Côté, \u0026amp; Abernathy, 2003), flying airplanes (McKinney, \u0026amp; Davis, 2003), studying at home by middle-school students (Rosário, Núñez, Valle, González-Pienda, \u0026amp; Lourenço, 2013) and practice of a soccer team under the direction of a coach (Hendry, 2012). Although soccer practices are led by a coach, this type of practice is not individualized to address each individual players’ weaknesses and needs.\nSomebody might argue that the requirement of only including studies citing Ericsson and colleagues restricted the inclusion to data of deliberate practice. However, 45 effect sizes (88% of the effect sizes in the domain of Education) came from studies that never used the term “deliberate practice” anywhere in the text of their articles. Their only mention of deliberate practice was in the reference section as part of the title of Plant, Ericsson, Hill and Asberg’s (2005) paper. The main conclusion of Plant et al.’s (2005) paper was that the hours of study time by students did NOT measure effective practice and that it differed from deliberate practice.\nAnother argument that Macnamara \u0026amp; Hambrick (2020) might make is that in the discussion of differences of deliberate practice compared to play and work, Ericsson et al. (1993) even wrote: “In comparison to play, deliberate practice is a highly structured activity, the explicit goal of which is to improve performance” (p. 368). A few sentences later the same text states that deliberate practice “is not enjoyable” (p. 368). The first sentence was, however, not intended by us to be a definition of deliberate practice, not any more than the second sentence. Consequently, all activities that are not enjoyable, such as falling during a gymnastics routine and putting ice on sore limbs, do not meet the criteria for deliberate practice.\nIn a recent effort to explicate consequences of conducting a meta-analysis of the relation to achievement based on different definitions of accumulated structured versus deliberate and purposeful practice, Ericsson \u0026amp; Harwell (2019) examined all the studies included in Macnamara et al.’s (2014) meta-analysis, but they restricted entry to only those studies that met criteria for purposeful and deliberate practice. In addition, their meta-analysis excluded two cases where Macnamara et al. (2014) included the same data set more than once, when the same data were included in the analyses in two different publications. Ericsson \u0026amp; Harwell’s (2019) meta-analysis found that the relation between attained performance and purposeful and deliberate practice was substantially stronger than those reported by Macnamara et al. (2014), and these variables accounted for over 50% of the variance in performance after attenuation. Macnamara and Hambrick were both co-authors to a recent analysis which showed that over 50% of the variance in peak chess rating could be accounted for by variables related to practice (Burgoyne, Nye, Macnamara, Charness, \u0026amp; Hambrick, 2019).\nThe origin of the definition of structured practice in Macnamara et al. (2014) # The first public report that described the meta-analysis, which was eventually published in Psychological Science, appeared as Chapter 6 in Macnamara’s (2014) doctoral dissertation. The scope of her dissertation was impressive and included a couple of longitudinal studies, a pair of experimental studies, and one meta-analysis that each examined determinants of performance with subtitle “Cognitive Abilities, Experiential Factors and Predictability of the Task Environment” (p. i).\nThe first two studies of her dissertation examined the longitudinal changes of performance, where accumulated experience was measured by traditional indicators, such as the number of years working as a translator or the number of years of study toward becoming a translator by students. In Chapter 5 of her dissertation, she mentions deliberate practice, which provides some insights into her understanding of the concept. In one of her experimental studies, participants were playing a video game, and prior to each training block, the experimenter gave the same information about a character in the game to all participants, The participants were instructed to use that information while simply playing the game by themselves for a fixed time period to improve their performance. It is notable that she referred to each block of practice as a deliberate practice block. In the abstract to her dissertation, she described her final study, which examined whether her findings on predictability of task environment “translated into real-world domains, a meta-analysis was conducted examining the relationship between practice and performance variance.” (Macnamara, 2014, p. v, italics added).\nIn Chapter 6, she reports on her meta-analysis and describes her search for studies of practice and performance. She defined the targeted type of practice (structured practice) “as engagement in structured activities created specifically to improve performance in a domain” (Macnamara, 2014, p. 110). Her criteria for inclusion of a study were that it studied “practice activities interpretable as deliberate practice” (Macnamara, 2014, p. 114, italics added) and the need for citations to the research by myself and collaborators. Her initial search found 9331 papers and she identified 88 papers that met the above criterion and a few other criteria unrelated to the type of practice. It appears that she was the only person, who selected the 88 papers because no additional information is given, but considerable detail is given on how the mediator variables were coded for the 88 papers. The meta-analysis reported in her dissertation was reproduced without any changes in Macnamara et al. (2014), which implies that her co-authors agreed with her selection of studies.\nIn sum, an alternative account of Macnamara and Hambrick (2020) accusation that my colleagues and I changed our definition of deliberate practice would suggest that Macnamara (2014) misrepresented our original definition of deliberate practice. Macnamara et al. (2014, p. 1608) clearly stated that they wanted to rely on our original definition of “deliberate practice, which Ericsson et al. defined as engagement in structured activities created specifically to improve performance in a domain”, where “Ericsson et al.” refers to Ericsson et al. (1993) in the previous sentence. Based on the assumption made by Macnamara and Hambrick (2020) that their definition of structured practice was the correct interpretation of our original definition of deliberate practice, it is understandable they might have perceived our introduction of the new theoretical terms, naïve and purposeful practice, as involving changes to our original definition, as they had incorrectly understood it.\n“Theoretical Term Swapping” versus discovery of overlooked aspects of the original definition of deliberate practice # The original definition of deliberate practice has five criteria but Macnamara and Hambrick (2020) focus almost exclusively on a single criterion, namely the necessity that a teacher or a coach guides the practice activities, They cite sentences stating, for example that “activities can be designed by external agents, such as teachers or trainers, or by the performers themselves.” (Keith \u0026amp; Ericsson, 2007, p. 136) to argue that we argue that deliberate practice “does not require a teacher”. Being a non-native speaker of English, I turned to academic papers on the meaning of “or”. Dickerson (1960) insists that the default interpretation of “or” is as “and/or” rather than the exclusive “or”. By giving the sentence above an interpretation in terms of an exclusive “or”, Macnamara and Hambrick (2020) argue that any practice activity where individuals attempt to acquire skilled performance by deciding what to do during practice (designing their own practice activities) by themselves is a legitimate example of structured practice. It is understandable that somebody who believes that structured practice is equivalent to deliberate practice might be confused when Moxley et al. (2017) argue that self-study in SCRABBLE is not deliberate practice but rather an example of purposeful practice. As shown earlier, the original definition of deliberate practice remains unchanged and purposeful practice refer to a practice activity that meets the first four criteria of deliberate practice, but lacks individualized training guided by a teacher or coach.\nChallenges related to assessing individualized training guided by a teacher or a coach # In our original paper, Ericsson et al. (1993) studied highly motivated advanced students in a famous music academy. These participants viewed “solitary practice” as the most relevant practice activity for improving performance. When music students work individually with their respective master teacher, practice alone provide the external preconditions for highly effective learning. In a recent paper (Ericsson, 2020), I expanded earlier observations that the external conditions do not by themselves cause improvement. I discussed findings that some young music students did not improve performance during solitary practice even though they were supervised by a teacher. Analyses of videotape of the practice of these piano students showed that they were unable or not sufficiently motivated to engage with full concentration on attaining the assigned goals, and they kept hitting the same sequence of keys over and over. Another limitation is that motivated students studying with an experienced teacher of reading Tarot cards, who engage in their assigned practice are very unlikely to increase the accuracy of their predictions about their clients’ future. In our theoretical framework, the teacher is an agent communicating accumulated knowledge about how learning can best proceed in a given domain. “In all major domains, there has been a steady accumulation of knowledge about the best methods to attain a high level of performance and the associated practice activities leading to this performance. Full-time teachers and coaches are available for hire and supervise the personalized training of individuals at different levels of performance starting with beginners.” (Ericsson et al., 1993, p. 368). To implement the fifth criterion for deliberate practice, the type of support provided by teachers will differ as function of age and attained skill level of the trainee.\nIn domains with individualized instruction such as a child\u0026rsquo;s first introduction to the domain of music performance, this guidance by teachers might be very direct, step by step. However, with acquired skill music students develop their own mental representations, so they can image the sound of music that they cannot yet produce. This allows them to generate iteratively an actual music performance that matches their original image of the desired music experience (Ericsson \u0026amp; Harwell, 2019). When the master teachers interact with highly skilled music students, they will provide higher-level goals on how a segment of a given music piece can be played with more emphasis, tone, speed, and volume. During the solitary practice, the students will engage in problem solving and refine the particular practice activities that eventually permits them to play the music piece in the recommended manner. This type of complex interactive practice activity seemed best described as designed by the teachers or the performers themselves, where “or” is interpreted as “and/or”. In music and many other domains, the goal of training of beginners and intermediates is develop their mental representations so that they become skilled performers that are capable of generating many of the improvements by practicing alone.\nIn sum, the individualized training by teachers help the students to acquire correct fundamentals as beginners and encourage them to refine their mental representations; the accumulated number of hours of deliberate practice, therefore, is predicted to be related (correlated) with attained performance. However, future research is likely to allow descriptions of the longitudinal development in terms of each of the individuals’ practice sessions and the attained performance improvements. With these refined descriptions, it should be possible in the future to identify more of the contributions of practice to final level of achievement (Ericsson, 2016, 2020).\nThe relations between accumulated amount of deliberate practice on expert music performance (Ericsson et al., 1993) and the large effects of extended practice on many types of performance (Ericsson, Chase, \u0026amp; Faloon, 1980; Howe, Davidson, \u0026amp; Sloboda, 1998) raised the issue of searching for but not finding research studies directed towards measuring the role of genetic factors in the acquisition of high levels of performance (Plomin, 1998)—even more recent reviews of newer studies have not found evidence for substantial genetic contributions (Ericsson, 2014b, 2016, 2020). Macnamara et al. (2014) took a different approach and estimated how much of individual differences in attained performance could be accounted for estimates of accumulated hours of structured practice and argued that most of the remaining unexplained variance must reflect other factors than practice. These sums of hours of practice do not estimate the maximal accounts of performance by practice and the accounted variance is likely to greatly increase in the future with more refined measures of different types of practice. Our framework does not categorically reject any influence of genetic differences, but it requires that the predictive roles of particular genes and their interactions have to be demonstrated in the same way that rough measures of individual differences in practice have been able to do. In fact, our original paper (Ericsson et al., 1993) reviewed compelling evidence for the role of inherited genetic factors in determining height and their influence on success in sports, such as basketball. Although we did not find evidence for an important role of innate unmodifiable cognitive capacities developing independently without engagement in any activities (cf. height, our paper clearly stated: “It is quite plausible, however, that heritable individual differences might influence processes related to motivation and the original enjoyment of the activities in the domain and, even more important, affect the inevitable differences in the capacity to engage in hard work (deliberate practice)” (Ericsson et al., 1993, p. 399).\nConcluding remarks # Macnamara and Hambrick (2020, p. 5) summarize their view in their final paragraph: “The major finding from our own and others’ research on this topic is that deliberate practice, while certainly important, leaves a large amount of the inter-individual variability in expertise unexplained and potentially explainable by other factors” (p. 5. italics added). When I read this sentence, I am reminded of a similar conclusion in Ericsson et al.’s (1993, p. 400) paper in the absolutely last paragraph of the text of our paper with 41 pages: “We believe that a more careful analysis of the lives of future elite performers will tell us how motivation is promoted and sustained. It is also entirely plausible that such a detailed analysis will reveal environmental conditions as well as heritable individual differences that predispose individuals to engage in deliberate practice during extended periods and facilitate motivating them” (italics added). I look forward to new and further refined definitions and associated measures of amount and quality of different kinds of practice, that will take us beyond distinctions between naïve, purposeful, structured and deliberate practice and hopefully uncovering practice activities that will more effectively improve particular types of performance. This would allow the steady accumulation of empirical evidence to identify the best predictors of attained performance and performance improvements as I proposed in the final paragraph in Ericsson (2013, p. 535): “In the future we should be able to develop statistical models integrating genetic and training factors along with their interactions to account for the attained performance level of elite athletes”.\nReferences # Baker, J., Côté, J., \u0026amp; Abernethy, B.

In earlier times Hanwoo was used extensively for farming, transportation. Over the period of time, Hanwoo has changed to be meat type cattle. Full-scale production of Hanwoo as meat-type cattle has occurred since 1960s with the rapid growth of the Korean economy. Hanwoo is one of the most economically important species in Korea as it is a significant source of nutrition to the Korean people. Hanwoo beef is the most cherished food of Korea. One of the main goals of researchers is to increase the meat quality, quantity and taste of the beef. In this review we describe the origin, domestication of Hanwoo cattle and breeding program initiated from 1980’s. Moreover the advent of technological advancement had provided us a platform to perform genome wide selection on economic traits and its implementation into traditional breeding programs.\nKeywords: Hanwoo (Korean cattle), Origin, Domestication and breeding program\nIntroduction # Hanwoo (Korean cattle) is the native, taurine type, small sized cattle breed of Korea and its history as a draft animal dates back to 5000 Years. In earlier times Hanwoo was used extensively for farming, transportation and for religious sacrifice. Over the period of time Hanwoo cattle has evolved to be meat type cattle. Full-scale production of Hanwoo as meat-type cattle has occurred since 1960s with the rapid growth of the Korean economy. Despite its high price, beef from Hanwoo cattle is very popular among both Koreans and foreigners. Hanwoo beef is known for its marbled fat, tenderness, juiciness and characteristic flavor. There are four breeds of Hanwoo in Korea viz. brown Hanwoo, brindle Hanwoo, black Hanwoo and jeju black (Figure 1). Among all these colour variants brown is the most common one (Figure 1). National Institute of Animal Science along with the small stakeholders has taken an initiative for a better management and improvement of Hanwoo cattle. Hanwoo Experiment Station (A Research Station of National Institute of Animal Science) in Pyeongchang-gun, Gangwon-do, Korea is dedicated exclusively for research on Hanwoo cattle. Along with Hanwoo experiment station there are other institutes and universities as well which are working towards the betterment of this native cattle breed.\nFigure 1 figure1 Pictures of four Hanwoo cattle. (A) Brown Hanwoo, (B) Brindle Hanwoo, (C) Black Hanwoo and (D) Jeju black Hanwoo.\nFull size image\nKorea along with Hanwoo has a market for imported beef from Australia, USA, New Zealand, Canada and Mexico as well (KMTA, [1]). When Hanwoo beef was compared with the Australian Angus, it showed characteristic compositional and quality differences that should result from genetic and environmental differences between them [2]. Hanwoo is lower in cholesterol compared to other beef. It also has a higher omega 3 fatty acid count which makes it healthier than beef from other cattle. Taste-wise, it’s very soft, juicy, and delicious. The marbling in Hanwoo steak is excellent as well and it has the right balance of meat and fat. Korean consumers decided their overall acceptability of Hanwoo beef are as follows: weights of tenderness 55%, juiciness 18%, and flavor-likeness 27% [3]. No wonder Korean consumers, despite the high price prefer Hanwoo beef to the imported one. In order to produce high quality Hanwoo beef along with specially designed breeding programs special care and feed strategies are deployed.\nThe major goal of researchers is to increase both the quality (Marbling, tenderness and flavor) and the quantity (Carcass weight) of the meat to benefit the Hanwoo beef industry. Therefore, the current selection index used in Korea Proven Bulls (KPN) program is based on 1) carcass weight on marbling score 2) the comparison on carcass weight. In order to support the beef industry along with the conventional selection program, the genomic selection is also being incorporated in selection and breeding programs. In the present review we discussed the origin, domestication, breeding strategies and genomic selection in Hanwoo cattle.\nOrigin and Domestication # Origin and domestication of not just Hanwoo but all north-east asian cattle is a topic of discussion among researchers. Researchers are of divided view when it comes to ancestry and domestication of Hanwoo. There are some studies on the origin and ancestry of this cattle breed. Han S. W., [4] suggested Hanwoo to be a cross between zebu and taurine cattle, which migrated to Korea from Mongolia via north china while Lee \u0026amp; Pollack [5] proposed Hanwoo to have originated as a hybrid from auroch and zebu cattle. Yoon et al. [6] suggested an independent domestication event for Hanwoo. Mannen et al. [7] also suggested the independent mitochondrial origin in Asian cattle. Their study included Mongolian, Korean and Japanese cattle. In a recent study McTavish et al. [8] suggested that the asian cattle (Hanwoo and Japanese Black) to be of hybrid taurine–indicine origin.We carried out cattle diversity analysis which showed a clear differentiation of asian taurine from western taurine cattle (Figure 2B-2C). Based on 50 K SNP chip data we computed a neighbor joining phylogenetic tree where we observed a clear partitioning for African taurine, European taurine, Asian taurine and Zebu cattle. The tree clearly clustered Korean cattle breeds on a separate node than the European taurine cattle breeds. This might suggest a separate domestication event for north-east asian cattle. Also, mitochondria based studies have identified a haplotype T4 that is observed in north east asian cattle breeds but not in other breeds (Mannen et al., [7]). The PCA plot also clearly separated Hanwoo and Wagyu (Japanese cattle) from Hereford and angus cattle thus supporting the inference from neighbor joining tree.\nFigure 2 figure2 Comparison of Hanwoo compared to other taurine cattle.

Lee et al., [9] performed a LD analysis and studied Ne for the entire Korean Hanwoo cattle genome, which was the first LD map and effective population size estimate ever calculated for this breed. A panel of 4,525 markers was used in the final LD analysis. The pairwise r2 statistic of SNPs up to 50 Mb apart across the genome was estimated. A mean value of r2 = 0.23 was observed in pairwise distances of \u0026lt;25 kb and dropped to 0.1 at 40 to 60 kb, which is similar to the average intermarker distance used in this study. The proportion of SNPs in useful LD (r2 ≥ 0.25) was 20% for the distance of 10 and 20 kb between SNPs. Analyses of past effective population size estimates based on direct estimates of recombination rates from SNP data demonstrated a decline in effective population size to Ne = 98.1 up to three generations ago (Figure 3). In this population genetic parameter (LD and Ne) study, the Ne in Hanwoo was larger overall than in North American Holstein cattle. In particular, the Ne of Hanwoo dramatically decreased 25 generations ago, this is when official Hanwoo breeding programs were initiated. Effect of selection pressure on Ne in the Hanwoo population was evident from this study.\nFigure 3 figure3 Effective population size from chromosome of the past Hanwoo (Korean cattle) population. Effective population size was estimated in each autosomal chromosome. The generation in the past population was calculated as 1/2c. Ne is plotted against the past generation up to 500 generation. (Extracted from [10]). Full size image\nHanwoo breeding program # Marbling score (MS), carcass weight (CWT), eye muscle area (EMA) and back fat thickness (BF) are the traits to impact Korean beef industry the most. Therefore the selection index for Korea Proven Bulls uses eye muscle area on marbling score and their comparison on CWT.\nThe first genetic breeding program called “Hanwoo-Gaeryang-Danji (HGD)” was initiated by Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) in 1979. However, due to lack of awareness in the farmers to record the data and scarcity of the trained emulators, the program didn’t meet its objective. In 1999, a new program called “Hanwoo-Gaeryang-Nongga (HGN)” was introduced. Whereas HGD focused on a particular province HGN concentrated on individual farms. The cows from HGN program are used as major breeding stock for “Hanwoo Performance and Progeny Test (HPPT)” program (MAF, [11]). Prior to the HPPT program, bulls to be used for artificial insemination were selected solely on the basis of phenotypes. It was in 1987 that the first proven bull was produced using HPPT program. As shown in Figure 4, the HPPT program was a two stage selection program. The first stage was a performance test for the young bulls and the second stage was progeny test of selected young bulls. Young bull calves of current proven bulls were harvested at the age of 6 months from HGN belonging to HGD based on their phenotypic values and underwent a performance test up to age of 12 months. At this stage young bulls were selected based on a combination of their breeding values of weight at 12 months and average daily gain estimated from its performance test records. In the progeny test, cows from the HGN program were inseminated with the semen from young bulls and the male calves were harvested from farms and raised for the station progeny test. These steers were raised in a group until slaughter at 24 months. Carcass data comprised EMA, BF, MAR and CWT. Based on the progeny test results 20 bulls are selected for the AI program. Selection is based on a selection index which used weighted breeding values for BF, MAR and EMA.\nFigure 4 figure4 Pictorial representation of Hanwoo performances and progeny test (HPPT) program.\nFull size image Park et al. [12] carried out a study to determine the trend of improvement as well as the estimation of genetic parameters of the traits being used for seedstock selection based on the data collected from the past. In his study he concluded that the performance and progeny test based selection system of Korea is good enough to accommodate circumstances where fewer sires are used on many more cows. Although progeny tests take longer and cost more, they seem to be appropriate under the circumstances of the domestic market with its higher requirement for better meat quality. The study suggested accumulative data collection, genetic evaluation model development, revision of selection indices, as well as cooperation among farms, associations, National Agricultural Cooperative Federation, universities, research institutes and government agencies must be applied to the Hanwoo selection program. According to the Park’s study, the current progeny tested evaluation runs every 6 months to select KPN in Korea. The breeding program has achieved a substantial genetic improvement for CWT and EMA. However there has been just a slightly negative genetic response for MS with an -0.036 of genetic response per year [12].\nThe heritability and genetic correlation are important genetic parameters in breeding program. In Hanwoo population, heritability and genetic correlation were estimated using carcass data from National Hanwoo progeny tested population (Figure 5A). A negative genetic correlation was observed between BF and EMA (-0.2) and MS and BF (-0.02) while positive correlation was observed in all other traits. A high positive correlation was observed between EMA and CWT (0.45) indicating that a greater EMA is associated with a higher production of CWT. The value of correlation between EMA and CWT in our study is more than that reported by and Koch et al. [13] and less as reported by Baik et al. [14] and Cundiff et al. [15]. High estimated heritabilities for BF (0.5), EMA (0.41), MS (0.4) and moderate for CWT (0.33) were observed. This indicates that in Hanwoo cattle a considerable genetic variability still exits which may be used for the improvement of carcass traits. Estimation of heritability, from genome-wide SNPs has recently attracted interest and offers several advantages over traditional pedigree-based methods. A comparison of pedigree and genotype based heritability for carcass traits was thus drawn (Figure 5B). The amount of variation that could be accounted for by SNP genotypes was concordant with pedigree-based heritabilities and varied from very low for CWT to medium-high for BF.\nFigure 5 figure5 Heritability and genetic correlation for carcass trait in Hanwoo. Data are taken from a report for Hanwoo genetic improvement meeting (2013).

The traditional methods are often not so accurate, inefficient and time consuming as most traits like meat quality are hard to measure and evident only when animal reaches maturity leading to a delay in verifying breeding results. With the advent of genome wide SNP panels we can overcome the drawbacks of the conventional breeding methods. Genome wide SNP panels will allow us to accurately and cost \u0026amp; time effectively determine the genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) even in young animals and thus select animals at young age.\nGenetic architecture for carcass trait in Hanwoo # Korean beef industry lay emphasis on meat yield and quality traits like carcass weight, marbling, intramuscular fat, eye muscle area. To identify the significant associations of SNPs with these traits can directly affect the selection of animals for a breeding program.\nGenome-wide association study (GWAS) is a process for inspection and screening of detectable common genetic variants (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) in individuals to identify the variant(s) associated with the trait under study. There are several GWAS studies that are successfully conducted in livestock species. A recent study on Hanwoo cattle conducted by lee et al. (2013) identified 6 highly significant SNPs on chromosome 14 to be associated with carcass weight in Hanwoo cattle (Figure 6). This genome-wide association study was conducted to identify major loci that are significantly associated with carcass weight, and their effects, so as to provide an insight into the genetic architecture of carcass weight in Hanwoo. This genome-wide association study identified a major chromosome region ranging from 23 Mb to 25 Mb on chromosome 14 as being associated with carcass weight in Hanwoo. The most significant SNP detected was BTB-01280026 (P = 4.02 × 10-11), located in the 25 Mb region on Bos taurus autosome 14 (BTA14). The most significant SNPs accounted for 6.73% to 10.55% of additive genetic variance, which is quite a large proportion of the total additive genetic variance. The most significant SNP (BTB-01280026; P = 4.02 × 10-11) had 16.96 kg of allele substitution effect, and the second most significant SNP (Hapmap27934-BTC-065223; P = 4.04 × 10-11) had 18.06 kg of effect on carcass weight, which correspond to 44% and 47%, respectively, of the phenotypic standard deviation for carcass weight in Hanwoo cattle. Our results demonstrated that carcass weight was affected by a major Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) with a large effect and by many SNPs with small effects that are normally distributed. As evident from manhattan plots of GWAS for four carcass traits shown in Figure 6 a highly significant association was observed for carcass weight on BTA14 while for other three traits there was no such association observed which shows the effect of many genes on a trait across all chromosomes.\nFigure 6 figure6 Association of SNPs with the carcass traits in the Hanwoo shown as a Manhattan plot.\nFull size image In order to determine if polygenic inheritance is a general phenomenon for carcass traits in Hanwoo population, we directly estimated the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the common SNPs on each chromosomes. Proportion of variance attibuted to each chromosome averaged across four carcass traits against chromosome length (Figure 7) was calculated using genotype relationship matrix (GRM) on each chromosomes which supported the results shown in manhattan plots of GWAS. While for all other traits we can see most of the chromosomes having marginal effect but for CWT where Chromosome 14 is clearly showing a high effect on the trait. By calculating the proportion of the genome represented by each chromosome (not including the length of sex chromosomes), we tested for a correlation between the variance explained by each chromosome relative to its size. It was observed that several of the smaller chromosomes contributed less to the overall variance than several of the larger chromosomes, however trend was not significant.\nFigure 7 figure7 Proportion of variance attibuted to each chromosome averaged across four carcass traits against chromosome length.\nFull size image Also there are reports on GWAS studies on other traits of economical importance such as MS, IMF, EMA and sensory panel. Yi et al. [16] carried out a GWAS study to identify QTL for growth and carcass quality traits using high-density SNP panels. The data set comprised of 61 sires, their 486 steers, and the 54,001 SNP markers on 29 bovine autosomal chromosomes. Traits to be analyzed in this study were six growth and carcass quality traits including weaning weight (WWT), 365-d yearling weight (YWT), CWT after slaughter, BF, EMA, and MS. A total of 16(0), 18(4), 20(13), 11(23), 10(13) and 19(1) SNPs were detected at the 5% chromosome (genome)-wise level for the traits, WWT, YWT, CWT, BF, EMA and MS, respectively. Among the 148 SNPs, 91 SNPs had dominance effects, suggesting that dominance inheritance mode be considered in genetic improvement for growth and caracass quality in Hanwoo. Thirty five QTL regions on 17 Bos taurus chromosomes (i.e. BTA 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 23, 26, and 28) were detected. Strong evidence for the QTL influencing CWT were detected on BTA14. Also, the QTL for WWT, YWT, BF, and EMA were detected on BTA20. The GWAS studies could thus greatly help in developing the selection strategies for breeding programs.\nGenomic strategy for breeding scheme # Genomic selection (GS) employs selection of an individual based on the genomic breeding value assessed through evaluating all the genetic markers located throughout the genome of that individual. Thus, the underlying principle of GS is to exploit the linkage disequilibrium of the QTL with one or more genetic marker(s) [17]. Molecular markers can be used to predict GBV of breeding animals by exploiting population-wide linkage disequilibrium between QTL and genetic markers spanned over the genome. The key–factor behind the success of genomic selection is to utilize the next generation sequencing approaches and the associated bioinformatics tools to identify the SNPs. Simulation studies in some domesticated species like, beef cattle, swine and chicken (Meuwissen et al., [18]) have suggested that the breeding values can be predicted with high accuracy using genetic markers alone but its validation is required especially in samples of the population different from that in which the effect of the markers was estimated. In genomic selection, the estimation of genomic breeding values is predicted to sum up all loci that are estimated based on phenotypes and genotypes in training population. This is particularly useful for traits that are very difficult to measure, such as marbling. The accuracy of these genomic predictions depends on the genetic architecture of the complex traits. For example, number of loci affecting the trait and distribution of their effects. In case of Hanwoo, MAS (Marker Associated Selection) and GS will provide a way to predict phenotype of marbling score as a preselection method that can be used in performance test [19].\nStrategies for genomic selection program in Hanwoo # Application of genomic selection in Hanwoo preselection process such as performance test and then in progeny test in the breeding program might raise the genetic gain for marbling. A comparison of accuracy of GEBV and traditional EBV is tabulated in Table 1. In order to estimate the genomic breeding value, well organized reference population (Training data set) is to be build. The two most important features of reference population are 1) to representation of the entire Hanwoo population (all the variants) and the sample size. For the same, current progeny tested steers, selected proven bulls and candidate bulls from the progeny test program will be a reasonable population. Reference population must contain minimum of 5,000 animals. A genetic gain of 30% can be observed if we have a large reference population.\nTable 1 Accuracy of GEBV and traditional EBV estimated by 50 K SNP chip for Hanwoo cattle\nTraits BLUP GBLUP Difference Eye muscle area (cm2) 0.11(0.08) 0.29(0.07) 0.18 Back fat thickness (mm) 0.11(0.08) 0.30(0.11) 0.19 Marbling score (1 ~ 9) 0.11(0.08) 0.27(0.12) 0.16 Full size table\nConclusion # Recent advances in molecular biotechnology facilitate not only detection of genes that contribute to genetic variation of quantitative traits but also incorporation of genomic information into a conventional animal breeding program. The incorporated molecular information into GEBV may achieve an improvement of EBV and selection accuracy in cattle populations. In conclusion, we suggest incorporating molecular information into the conventional breeding programs to achieve better results in comparatively shorter time. Including molecular information will be a step further to achieve higher standards of Hanwoo beef.\nReferences # Korea Meat Trade Association (KMTA): Information and Data of Agricultural Statistics Of Korea. 2011, Accessed on January 12, 2011. http://kmta.or.kr/html/sub6-1.html?scode=6, Google Scholar Jo C, Cho SH, Chang J, Nam KC: Keys to production and processing of Hanwoo beef: a perspective of tradition and science.

In this longitudinal study, we tracked and conducted in-depth psychiatric interviews with twins who participated in an epidemiological survey and screened positive on a measure of hoarding symptoms at age 15. Twins screening positive for clinically significant hoarding symptoms at age 15 (n = 42), their co-twins (n = 33), a group of screen negative twins (n = 49), and their parents underwent a clinical assessment a median of 3 years after the initial screening. The assessment included psychiatric screening, hoarding symptoms and cognitions, in-home or photographic assessment of clutter levels, parental accommodation and familial burden. None of the participants had significant levels of clutter at follow-up and thus did not meet strict criteria for HD. However, twins meeting partial criteria (i.e., DSM-5 criteria A and B) for HD (n = 28) had more psychiatric disorders and scored significantly higher on all measures of hoarding symptoms including researcher-rated levels of clutter in their homes, compared to twins who did not meet partial criteria for HD (n = 46). As currently defined in DSM-5, HD may be rare in young people. A non-negligible proportion of young people who were screen positive on hoarding symptoms at age 15 had substantial hoarding symptoms and other psychopathology at follow-up. Whether and how many of these individuals will develop full-blown HD is unknown but the results offer unique insights about the probable origins of HD in adolescence.\nKeywords Hoarding disorder · Adolescence · Developmental · Twin study · Diagnostic criteria\nIntroduction # Hoarding disorder (HD) is characterized by a persistent difficulty discarding one’s possessions due to a perceived need to save the possessions and distress associated with discarding [1]. These difficulties result in severely cluttered living spaces, distress and/or functional impairment, which impact their quality of life and that of family members and the wider community [2, 3]. Prevalence estimates indicate that HD affects approximately 2.5% of the working-age population [4, 5] with some evidence suggesting that it becomes more prevalent with increasing age [6].\nAlthough most individuals who seek help or come to the attention of services are middle-aged or elderly, the origins of hoarding difficulties are likely to be found in childhood. Retrospective reports of adult individuals with HD consistently suggest that the first symptoms appeared in childhood and remained mild during adolescence and young adulthood, before deteriorating and remaining chronic throughout the lifespan [7,8,9]. These retrospective reports also suggest that the most impairing feature of HD, the accumulation of clutter, begins to cause clinically significant impairment by the third decade of life [7,8,9,10]. However, investigations of hoarding symptoms in childhood and adolescence have been rare [11, 12], and longitudinal investigations across the lifespan are lacking.\nRecent community-based work has shown that hoarding symptoms indeed occur during childhood and adolescence, and may be fairly prevalent (estimates widely ranging from 2 to 9% of the population) [6, 10, 13]. A number of studies have also examined the correlates of hoarding symptoms in treatment-seeking samples of youth with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) [14, 15], attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [16, 17], autism spectrum disorders (ASD) [18] and anxiety disorders [19], reporting high rates of hoarding symptoms in all these clinical groups. However, ‘caseness’ definitions have varied and since these estimates are based on self-report, it is unclear how many of these individuals would meet diagnostic criteria for HD. Further insights into the clinical presentation of hoarding symptoms in youth come from a limited number of case reports, which suggest that the core features of HD (difficulties discarding possessions due to a perceived need to save them and associated distress with discarding them are indeed present in childhood and adolescence. However, other features such as excessive acquisition and clutter are thought to be much less common and prominent in children [10, 20, 21]. Parental control over living spaces and restricted freedom while living at home, are factors that likely alter and limit, the features and consequences of hoarding behavior in young people [22].\nIn general, previous research on childhood hoarding has suffered from a number of methodological limitations, including the study of hoarding features in the context of other disorders, such as OCD or ADHD, and the fact that no studies employed current DSM-5 criteria to diagnose cases. It is, therefore, unclear how informative these previous studies are and whether the DSM-5 criteria are helpful in non-adult populations. An improved understanding of the developmental origins of hoarding symptoms in childhood and adolescence has the potential to influence the refinement of the diagnostic criteria and more importantly, given the chronicity and deleterious long-term effects of HD, to inform future prevention and intervention strategies.\nThis prospective longitudinal study aimed to further understand the features, family impact and natural history of hoarding symptoms in youth. We followed-up and interviewed a group of twins who participated in a large, population-based study [10] and screened positive for clinically significant hoarding symptoms at age 15. Specifically, these individuals, their co-twins, screen negative twins and their parents underwent a detailed psychiatric evaluation 1–6 years (median 3 years) after their initial screening, including the assessment of hoarding symptoms and cognitions, clutter levels, parental accommodation of symptoms and familial burden.\nMethods # Participants # Study participants were 15-year old monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins and their parents from the Swedish Twin Registry taking part in the longitudinal Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (CATSS). Starting in 2004, the parents of all twins in Sweden born 1992 and onward were contacted when they turned 9 or 12 years [23]. The first follow-up wave of CATSS included 8455 twins from all over Sweden born 1994–1996 and who had turned 15 (CATSS-15). All these twins were screened for hoarding symptoms using the Hoarding Rating Scale-Self Report (HRS-SR) [24], a widely used measure of hoarding symptoms that possesses excellent psychometric properties. A total of 3974 twins returned the questionnaires. Participants who scored at least moderately (a score of 4 or higher out of 8) on items measuring clutter, difficulties discarding and distress and/or impairment were considered to have clinically significant hoarding symptoms based on established cut-off values [24, 25]. Additional information about the sample can be found in the original publication [10]. In the present study, all twins who screened positive for significant hoarding symptoms at age 15 (n = 79; 2% of the screened sample), along with screen negative co-twins (n = 67) and one parent to every twin pair were contacted and offered participation in a face-to-face assessment, which took place 1–6 years (median = 3 years) after the initial screening. For comparison, we also randomly selected and contacted 76 screen-negative twins from CATSS-15. Screen-negative individuals were defined as scoring \u0026lt;4 on HRS-SR items measuring difficulties discarding, clutter in one’s room, distress and impairment.\nA total of 42 (53%) of all screen positive twins, 33 of their co-twins (49% of all co-twins) and 49 screen-negative (64% of all screen negative) and their parents agreed to participate in the follow-up interviews. Overall, there were few differences between participants and non-participants. No differences emerged in terms of zygosity and rates of ADHD, ASD and OCD (p values ranging from 0.30 to 1.00). However, participants from the screen-positive group who took part in the current study had significantly higher HRS-SR total scores compared to those who declined participation (19.1 vs. 14.1; t = − 3.31, df = 107, p \u0026lt; 0.05). Furthermore, in the screen negative group, there were significantly more boys among individuals who declined participation (48% vs. 25%; χ2 = 4.751, df = 1, p \u0026lt; 0.05). Participant flow throughout the stages of screening and assessment are displayed in Fig. 1 (Supplementary material).\nProcedures # All eligible participants and their parents were first contacted by post with information regarding the present study. Shortly thereafter, the twins were contacted via telephone and offered participation in the study. Assessments of the screen positive twins were conducted at either a test center in Stockholm, Sweden, a test center within the vicinity of their homes or in their homes, depending on the twin’s preference. Participants hailed from several locations across Sweden (see Fig. 2, Supplementary material) and the research team travelled to these locations to conduct the interviews. Participants who chose to not be assessed in their home were asked to provide representative photos of their bedroom. Twins who screened negative at age 15 were assessed over the telephone and were mailed self-report questionnaires. Parent assessments were conducted face-to-face or over the telephone. All assessments were carried out by two clinical psychologists and two graduate students majoring in psychology. All participants received gift vouchers of 500 SEK (50 USD) for their participation and took part in a competition to win an iPad. Ethical approval was obtained from the Regional Ethics Review Board in Stockholm (reference numbers: 2012/471-31/2, 2012/1673-32 and 2014/160-32). Written informed consent was obtained from all twins and their parents prior to their participation.\nMeasures # Researcher administered # Participants were screened for psychiatric diagnoses with the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) [26]. The Structured Interview for Hoarding Disorder (SIHD) was administered to diagnose HD. This instrument probes the six core criteria of HD as well as its two specifiers (excessive acquisition and level of insight) [27, 28]. Assessors based their judgement of whether a participant endorsed the diagnostic criteria on examination of participants’ reports and direct observation of the participant’s dwellings (when home visits were possible), and did not have access to current self-report measures at the time of assessment. The assessors rated the amount of clutter in the participant’s bedrooms using the Clutter Image Rating (CIR) [29]. Assessors also administered a shortened version of a hoarding interview developed by Pertusa et al. [30]. The instrument contains questions about types of saved items from a list of everyday objects and reasons for saving.\nSelf-reported measures # Hoarding symptoms were measured using the Saving Inventory-Revised (SI-R) [31] and the Hoarding Rating Scale-Self-Report (HRS-SR) [24]. In the present study, a modification was made to the clutter item of the HRS-SR to reflect the living situation of the responder referring to the persons own room instead of the entire home, unless the adolescent or young adult lived on their own. To examine hoarding beliefs, we used the Saving Cognitions Inventory (SCI) [32]. Autistic traits were self-rated with the Adult Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) [33] and the Brown Attention-Deficit Disorder Scales (BADDS) were used to measure executive function impairments typical for ADHD [34].\nParent-rated measures # The Children’s Saving Inventory (CSI) is a 23-item parent-rated instrument assessing child hoarding behaviors including acquisition, difficulty discarding, clutter, distress and impairment [35]. Levels of parental accommodation to twin hoarding behaviors (e.g., avoiding to discard the twins’ possessions) and family burden were measured with the Family Impact Scale for Hoarding (FISH) [36]. Parents to all twins were also interviewed with the parent versions of the ADHD and ASD sections of K-SADS-PL.\nStatistical analyses # Data were analyzed with STATA 13 (STATA Corporation, College Station, TX). As some of the individuals in our analyses were related (twin pairs), we used linear regression with a robust sandwich estimator option in STATA [vce (cluster)] to examine between-group differences on continuous variables (e.g., symptom levels of hoarding, ADHD and ASD) in the group comparisons. This option relaxes the requirement of independent observations when estimating standard errors and requires that observations are only independent across twin pairs (clusters) but not within twin pairs. Categorical data (e.g., gender, educational level and presence of comorbid diagnosis) were compared using chi-square tests and Fisher’s exact test. All statistical tests were two-tailed and the significance level was set to p \u0026lt; 0.05.\nResults # Endorsement of HD criteria # The proportion of participants from the screen positive and screen negative groups endorsing each of the diagnostic criteria and the two specifiers for HD are displayed in Table 1. As expected, participants from the screen-positive group were more likely to endorse almost all criteria for HD indicating an association between screening status at age 15 and endorsement of diagnostic criteria at the clinical interview. However, none of the participants were judged to have significant clutter in their rooms (DSM-5 criterion C) and, for that reason, none of the participants met full criteria for HD.\nTable 1 Endorsement of diagnostic criteria and specifiers for HD based on initial screening status\nDSM-5 criterion Group p value Screen positive (N = 42) Screen positive co-twins (N = 33) Screen negative (N = 49) N (%) N (%) N (%) A 20 (47.6) 8 (24.2) 4 (8.2) \u0026lt; 0.000 B 17 (40.5) 8 (24.2) 3 (6.1) \u0026lt; 0.000 C 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) N.A D 9 (21.4) 2 (6.1) 1 (2.0) \u0026lt; 0.05 Ea 17 (40.5) 8 (24.2) 3 (6.1) \u0026lt; 0.000 Fa 17 (40.5) 8 (24.2) 3 (6.1) \u0026lt; 0.000 Specifier Excessive acquisition 6 (14.3) 1 (3.0) 3 (6.1) 0.1681 Insight 1 (2.4) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0.4355 Criterion A: Persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of their actual value Criterion B: This difficulty is due to a perceived need to save items and to distress associated with discard- ing them Criterion C: The difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromises their intended use Criterion D: The hoarding causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (including maintaining a safe environment for self and others) a Only relevant for those endorsing criteria A and B Full size table\nOf the 42 participants in the screen-positive group, almost half (n = 20; 47.6%) endorsed DSM-5 criterion A (difficulties discarding or parting with possessions), while only 8 (24.2%) of the co-twins and 4 (8.2%) from the screen negative group endorsed this criterion (Table 1). Most participants (17/20) from the screen-positive group who met criterion A also met criterion B (difficulties discarding due to a perceived need to save the item or distress associated with discarding). However, three individuals from the screen-positive group reported difficulties letting go of possessions due to low motivation to clean out old items from their room, rather than needing to save these items or distress when discarding, and thus did not meet criterion B. Despite the general mild levels of clutter, 12 participants (nine from the screen-positive group, two co-twins and one from the screen-negative group) reported experiencing distress and/or impairment as a direct result of their hoarding behaviors. Reasons mentioned were being ashamed of these behaviors or due to the disorganization of things in their room caused by their hoarding. Finally, all participants who met criteria A and B also endorsed criteria E and F since their difficulties were deemed not to be the result of any alternative somatic or psychiatric conditions.\nWith regard to the HD specifiers, participants in the screen-positive group were twice as likely to endorse the excessive acquisition specifier compared to the screen negative group and almost five times as likely compared to the co-twins (Table 1). The between-group differences were however not statistically significant due to small numbers. Only one person in the screen-positive group had a poor insight.\nHoarding vs comparison groups # Based on criteria endorsement at the diagnostic interview, we categorized the participants into two new groups (hereafter the hoarding group and the comparison group) for all further analyses. The hoarding group (n = 28) consisted of participants from the original screen-positive group (n = 17), their screen negative co-twins (n = 8) and screen negative controls (n = 3) who reported persistent difficulties parting with possessions (criterion A) due to a perceived need to save the items and distress associated with discarding (criterion B) at the time of the interview. Participants from the screen-negative group who endorsed none of the diagnostic criteria for HD or only met criterion A were included in the comparison group (n = 46).\nDemographic variables # Table 2 displays the demographic and clinical characteristics for participants in the hoarding and the comparison groups. Participants in both groups were evenly matched and predominantly included girls and students. However, the mean age in the comparison group was slightly higher than in the hoarding group (18.2 vs. 19.0 years, t = 3.08, df = 72, p \u0026lt; 0.05). This difference likely occurred because participants in the screen negative group were contacted for clinical assessments some time after the screen-positive group (for matching reasons). However, age did not correlate with hoarding symptom severity at the time of the clinical assessments as measured with the SI-R and the HRS-SR in either group (p values ranging from 0.06 to 0.54). For this reason, age was not considered further in any subsequent analyses.\nTable 2 Demographic characteristics and psychiatric disorders in twins endorsing criteria A and B for hoarding disorder (hoarding group) compared to twins who did not endorse both criteria (comparison group)\nVariable Group Test stat p value Hoarding (N = 28) Comparison (N = 46) N (%) N (%) Gender, n (%) Female 23 (82.1) 35 (76.1) 0.3767 0.539 Age, mean (SD) 18.2 (1.2) 19.0 (0.9) 3.0787 \u0026lt; 0.05 Occupation, n (%) Student 22 (78.6) 28 (60.9) 2.4889 0.115 Working 4 (14.3) 13 (28.3) 0.2548 Unemployed 2 (7.1) 4 (8.7) 1.000 Diagnosis, n (%) Mood disorder (current) 3 (10.7) 0 (0.0) 0.051 Mood disorder (lifetime) 14 (50.0) 2 (4.3) \u0026lt; 0.000 Anxiety disorder (current) 15 (53.6) 4 (8.3) \u0026lt; 0.000 Anxiety disorder (lifetime) 5 (17.9) 0 (0.0) \u0026lt; 0.05 Eating disorder (current or lifetime) 2 (7.1) 4 (8.7) 1.00 OCD (current or lifetime) 1 (3.6) 0 (0.0) 0.378 ADHD (current or lifetime) 1 (3.6) 0 (0.0) 0.378 ODD (current or lifetime) 2 (7.1) 0 (0.0) 0.14 Any current or lifetime 22 (78.6) 7 (17.4) 29.3147 \u0026lt; 0.000 OCD obsessive–compulsive disorder, ADHD attention-deficit/hyperactivity-disorder, ODD oppositional defiant disorder Full size table\nPsychiatric diagnoses # As shown in Table 2, most psychiatric disorders were more likely to occur in the hoarding group. Twenty-two (78.6%) of the 28 participants in the hoarding group had at least one current or lifetime psychiatric disorder compared to seven (17.4%) in the comparison group. The most frequent current diagnosis in the hoarding group was an anxiety disorder (n = 15; 53.6%) while 14 participants (50.0%) reported a past episode of major depression. Notably, only one participant in the hoarding group met criteria for OCD (lifetime). Finally, self-reported symptoms of ADHD and ASD were both significantly higher in the hoarding group (Table 3).\nTable 3 Comparison of hoarding symptom severity, hoarding cognitions, family accommodation and family burden in the hoarding and comparison groups\nMeasure Rater Group F df p value Group Hoarding (N=28) Comparison (N = 46) Mean (SE) Mean (SE) SIR total Twin 30.79 (2.02) 9.83 (2.66) 61.97 49 \u0026lt; 0.000 SIR clutter Twin 8.68 (0.97) 3.39 (1.24) 18.04 49 \u0026lt; 0.000 SIR discarding Twin 14.00 (0.79) 3.43 (1.06) 99.25 49 \u0026lt; 0.000 SIR acquisition Twin 7.89 (0.81) 3.00 (0.92) 28.14 49 \u0026lt; 0.000 CSI total Parent 24.60 (3.79) 12.04 (4.75) 6.98 28 \u0026lt; 0.05 CSI discarding Parent 9.35 (1.42) 2.92 (1.65) 15.13 28 \u0026lt; 0.000 CSI clutter Parent 6.55 (1.01) 3.88 (1.43) 3.49 28 0.072 CSI acquisition Parent 4.25 (1.16) 3.28 (1.46) 0.44 28 0.5110 CSI dist/imp Parent 4.35 (0.62) 1.96 (0.75) 10.08 28 \u0026lt; 0.05 CIR Researcher 1.92 (0.11) 1.13 (0.13) 37.37 41 \u0026lt; 0.000 HRS-SR Twin 12.64 (1.20) 2.89 (1.47) 43.98 49 \u0026lt; 0.000 SCI Twin 70.29 (6.17) 40.50 (7.23) 16.96 49 \u0026lt; 0.000 FISH A Parent 3.50 (0.91) 0.63 (0.98) 8.58 29 \u0026lt; 0.05 FISH B Parent 0.05 (0.48) 0.43 (0.45) 0.74 28 0.3979 BADDS Twin 53.19 (3.59) 26.56 (4.68) 32.33 46 \u0026lt; 0.000 AQ Twin 17.56 (1.86) 11.46 (2.05) 8.87 48 \u0026lt; 0.05 SI-R saving inventory-revised, CSI children’s saving inventory, CIR clutter image rating, HRS-SR hoarding rating scale-self report, SCI saving cognitions inventory, FISH A family impact scale for hoarding-accom- modation subscale, FISH B family impact scale for hoarding-burden subscale, BADDS Brown’s ADD scales, AQ adult autism spectrum quotient Full size table\nHoarding symptom severity # As shown in Table 3, participants in the hoarding group had significantly higher scores than the comparison group on all self- and parent-rated hoarding symptom measures except the clutter and excessive acquisition subscales of the CSI. Inspection of SI-R subscales revealed that scores on the difficulty discarding subscales were highest while excessive acquisition and clutter were less prominent, but still significant. The higher levels of self-reported clutter in the hoarding group relative to the comparison group were corroborated by investigator ratings of clutter in the participants’ rooms using the CIR.\nFamily impact # Parent-rated measures were available for 20 (71%) of the participants included in the hoarding group and for 25 (54%) of those included in the comparison group. Parents of twins in the hoarding group reported higher levels of accommodation but not burden associated with the young persons’ hoarding behaviors (Table 3).\nSaved items and reasons for saving # Table 4 shows the types of saved items and their frequency in the hoarding and comparison groups. In general, participants from both groups reported saving similar items with books, tickets and letters/postcards being most frequent. However, the proportion of participants who saved these items was generally higher in the hoarding group than in the comparison group. Furthermore, participants in the hoarding group reported saving a significantly greater number of different classes of items (8.8 vs 2.7, respectively).\nTable 4 Types of saved items and number of different classes of saved items in the hoarding and comparison groups\nSaved item Group χ2/Fisher’s p value Hoarding (N=28) Comparison (N = 46) N (%) N (%) Books 19 (67.9) 11 (23.9) 13.94 \u0026lt; 0.000 Tickets 17 (60.7) 11 (23.9) 10.02 \u0026lt; 0.05 Letters/postcards 17 (60.7) 12 (26.1) 8.76 \u0026lt; 0.05 Old clothes 17 (60.7) 9 (19.6) 12.93 \u0026lt; 0.000 CD/DVDs 15 (53.6) 9 (19.6) 9.19 \u0026lt; 0.05 Pens 15 (53.6) 6 (13.0) 14.07 \u0026lt; 0.000 Old notes 14 (50.0) 2 (4.3) \u0026lt; 0.000 Receipts 13 (46.4) 10 (21.7) 4.95 \u0026lt; 0.05 Magazines 13 (46.4) 4 (8.7) \u0026lt; 0.000 Cardboard boxes 11 (39.3) 2 (4.3) \u0026lt; 0.000 Stuffed animals 11 (39.3) 2 (4.3) \u0026lt; 0.000 Old makeup 10 (35.7) 5 (10.9) \u0026lt; 0.05 Bills 9 (32.1) 6 (13.0) 3.93 \u0026lt; 0.05 Video games 8 (28.6) 5 (10.9) 0.065 Plastic bags 7 (25.0) 5 (10.9) 0.192 Wool/fabric 5 (17.9) 0 (0.0) \u0026lt; 0.05 Newspapers 3 (10.7) 1 (2.2) 0.149 Tools 3 (10.7) 0 (0.0) 0.051 Plastic containers 2 (7.1) 0 (0.0) 0.140 Old toys 2 (7.1) 0 (0.0) 0.140 School work 2 (7.1) 1 (2.2) 0.558 Electronic parts 2 (7.1) 0 (0.0) 0.140 Bodily products 1 (3.6) 0 (0.0) 0.378 Old food 1 (3.6) 0 (0.0) 0.378 Animals 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) NA NA Mean (SD) Mean (SD) Student’s t p No. of different classes of saved items 8.8 (4.3) 2.7 (2.7) 7.3483 \u0026lt; 0.000 Full size table\nAs shown in Table 5, participants from both study groups also largely reported similar reasons for saving.

Basic questions about the clinical phenomenology and natural history of hoarding symptoms in young people are largely unanswered. In this prospective study, we tracked a sample of twins screening positive for self-reported hoarding symptoms at age 15 and conducted in-depth interviews with them and their parents 3 years later. Our results showed that difficulties discarding due to a perceived need to save possessions and distress associated with discarding them (corresponding to diagnostic criteria A and B for HD in DSM-5) were present in a substantial proportion (40%) of participants who screened positive at age 15. However, none of the participants in our study presented with impeding levels of clutter (corresponding to diagnostic criterion C) at follow-up, even when taking parental involvement into account, and thus did not meet full criteria for HD.\nAlthough the absence of impending levels of clutter in our sample was the reason why HD could not be diagnosed, even when the criteria for clutter and distress/impairment were waived, only 40% (17/42) of those screening positive for clinically significant hoarding symptoms at age 15 were considered to actually meet criteria A and B at the follow-up clinical assessments. Thus, the HRS-SR (the screening instrument used at age 15) had relatively poor predictive value. It is important to note that the HRS-SR was developed for its use in adult populations and that hoarding behavior in young people might be a slightly different phenomenon than hoarding in adults. It is possible that the HRS-SR, which was designed to screen and quantify the severity of hoarding symptoms, may partly capture developmentally normal behavior in youth. Thus, some of the screen-positive cases may have been false positives. Additionally, hoarding symptoms might be less stable in youth than they are in adults; case studies have suggested that hoarding symptoms in childhood/adolescence may be episodic [21], and a recent epidemiological follow-up of the twin cohort in the current study revealed that hoarding symptoms were only moderately stable (r = 0.40) between ages 15 and 18 [37]. Regardless, based on our results, it is plausible that impeding levels of clutter simply are rare during adolescence, even among young people with stable hoarding symptoms. Our results suggest that HD, as currently defined in DSM-5, might be far less common in young people than previously suggested by previous studies relying on self-report measures [6, 10, 13].\nAlthough no participants meet full criteria for HD in our sample, by comparing those who met partial criteria for HD to those who did not, we were able to gain new insights into the clinical presentation and correlates of a group of non-treatment seeking young people with prominent hoarding symptoms. First, the assessment of diagnostic criteria endorsement was confirmed by all self- and parent-rated hoarding symptoms, which were higher for those who met partial criteria for HD (hoarding group). Based on the self-rated measures, and line with previous studies [10, 20, 21], difficulty discarding possessions was the most prominent feature in this group. Moreover, by including ratings of photographs of the participants’ rooms or carrying out assessments in their homes, we obtained more valid estimates of clutter [38] than in previous studies of young people. Our results showed that in youth with hoarding behaviors, the difficulties discarding possessions might already be resulting in heightened levels of clutter compared to non-hoarding youth. As expected, CIR scores in the hoarding group were lower than what is typically observed among community samples of adults with HD [4, 28] and support the data from retrospective adult reports suggesting that, for the average person with HD, levels of clutter first become impairing later in life [7]. Interestingly, and in contrast to previous studies suggesting that parents actively limit clutter in younger children [14, 21] participants in the hoarding group did not report that the lack of impeding clutter was due to parental involvement. This finding was also supported by parent-reported levels of accommodation, which albeit significantly higher than in the comparison group, were minimal compared to those reported by relatives and caretakers of adults with HD [2]. The notion that parental control over the adolescents’ space decreases as they grow older and become more independent, is however expected and resonates well with recent epidemiological findings indicating that shared environmental factors within twin pairs (e.g., parenting style) has an effect on hoarding symptoms at age 15 but not at ages 18 or 20–28 [37]. Our results suggest that late adolescence constitutes a period in development when possessions are saved and acquired without environmental influences posed by relatives or a spouse but have not yet accumulated to a degree that impairs function.\nAnalysis of the occurrence of psychiatric diagnoses revealed that participants in the hoarding group were more psychiatrically burdened than the comparison group. Moreover, the pattern of psychopathology was similar to that observed in adult samples, in which mood and anxiety disorders often co-occur with HD [4, 39, 40]. Notably, the finding that none of the participants in the hoarding group had co-occurring OCD, supports previous epidemiological reports [10, 13] indicating that hoarding symptoms present independently of OCD in a substantial proportion of adolescents. Furthermore, although, a diagnosis of ADHD was rare in any of the groups, symptoms of ADHD were common in the hoarding group. This is not surprising given the similarities in aspects of executive functioning (e.g., difficulties organizing and making decisions) common to both ADHD [41] and adult HD [42]. This finding also aligns with an emerging body of evidence suggesting a link between hoarding and ADHD in both children [16, 17, 43, 44] and adults [39, 43, 44]. A potential etiological overlap between hoarding and ADHD warrants further investigation and could potentially open up novel treatment avenues for HD. A potential link between hoarding and neuropsychiatric symptoms was also supported by the self-reported elevated symptoms of ASD in the hoarding group. This association might however not be specific to hoarding, but rather represent a link between ASD and general psychiatric burden, as has been suggested in adults with HD [45].\nExamination of saving behaviors revealed that participants in the hoarding group saved a wide range of everyday items, reported more reasons for saving than the comparison group and that a possible future use of their objects was the most frequently stated reason for saving. This finding is in contrast to previous literature [21, 22] stating that young people with hoarding symptoms collect worthless objects. Instead, these results resemble findings in adults with HD, who commonly save both valuable and less valuable objects such as clothes, newspapers, books, receipts and sentimental objects [30, 46, 47]. The similarity to adults with HD was also supported by reports showing that individuals with HD report more reasons for saving compared to non-hoarders [48] and most commonly report saving due to seeing a possible future use for the items and due to sentimental reasons [28].\nIn adults, HD is widely acknowledged to be a chronic, debilitating disorder that is difficult to treat [49]. The results of our study question the validity of the current DSM-5 criteria in young people. A more developmentally nuanced definition of problematic hoarding than the current DSM-5 criteria for HD is needed to identify individuals who may later develop full-blown HD. One way of refining the criteria for HD in young people would be to relax the clutter criterion, as potentially at-risk individuals will not display obvious signs of obstructive clutter during adolescence. More research into the ‘early warning signs’ in adolescence is needed to inform potential prevention strategies. Whether parent-reported instruments, such as the CSI [35] have better predictive value than self-reported instruments, such as the one used here, is an interesting question for the future.\nIn terms of treatment implications, our results suggest that interventions for young people with hoarding difficulties primarily should address difficulties discarding objects, hoarding related cognitions and practice of organizational skills of belongings while management of large amounts of clutter, excessive acquisition and parental accommodation should not be prioritized in treatment.\nOur study is the first prospective follow-up of youth who self-identified as having problematic hoarding behavior in adolescence. Strengths include the sample of non-selected and non-treatment seeking youth from the community and the use of multiple informants and in-depth interviews often conducted in the young person’s own home. Several limitations are also worth noting. First, the relatively short follow-up of approximately 3 years was clearly insufficient to determine if and how many of the participants from our sample would develop HD in the future. As HD is thought to gradually develop over several decades [7,8,9], such study would be difficult to conduct. Nevertheless, the striking similarities in phenomenology and comorbidity suggest that we captured a phenotype that may be a precursor to later-life, full-blown HD, at least in some individuals. Second, the difference in score on the HRS-SR between responders and non-responders in the screen negative group might have introduced bias; it could be argued, that twins with more severe hoarding symptoms would decline participation in the clinical assessments due to shame or fear of social stigmatization. However, since HRS-SR scores at age 15 were higher among those who participated in this study, it is more likely that we captured those with more severe current hoarding symptoms.\nReferences # American Psychiatric Association (2013) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, 5th ed.

Pini Via Pini 9, Milano, Italy e-mail: segreteria.jot@gpini.it\nAn original article (OA) is the publication of a study. Thus, it might be alternatively named “study report”, by analogy with “case report”. The Journal of Orthopaedics and Traumatology welcomes OAs based on clinical or preclinical studies relevant to the musculoskeletal system.\nAlthough medical research methodology is not the object of the following writing, proper planning and performing of investigations are necessary requirements for any good article. Three points have to be clear in the author’s mind: the hypothesis, the materials and methods through which the hypothesis is tested, and the results [1]. Only studies logically structured according to this sequence will be successfully transformed into worthwhile reports.\nPrecisely discussing the level of evidence is beyond the aims of the present editorial, but authors need to be aware that the design of their study affects the quality of the scientific information that is conveyed. Clinical studies may be roughly listed in order of decreasing evidence, as follows: randomized controlled trials (RCT), non-RCT prospective comparative studies, retrospective comparative studies, case-control studies and, lastly, case series [2].\nCase series, characterized by a low level of evidence, deserve publication only if the sample size and follow-up are strictly adequate. Sample size has to be at least similar or possibly larger than previously reported series. Minimum follow-up (not the mean follow-up) has to be long enough to allow observations of steady clinical and radiological outcomes. This means, for instance, 1 year for long bones fractures and 2 years for articular fractures with possible secondary degenerative joint disease.\nSpecial features are requested if the purpose of a case series is to estimate long-term survival of patients in relation to death or recurrency (e.g. musculoskeletal tumours), of organs in relation to prosthetic replacement (e.g. joints after corrective surgery or articular fracture reconstruction), and of prostheses in relation to failure (e.g. total hip or knee replacement). These series need not only an adequate minimum follow-up (generally several years), but also a proper survival analysis.\nAs far as prosthetic case series (standard total hip or knee arthroplasty) are concerned, the Editorial Committee sets a minimum follow-up of 8 years and a minimum sample size of 150 implants. Survival analysis should be preferably performed with the Kaplan-Meier estimator [3]. New and original prosthetic designs may represent an exception, for which smaller series and shorter follow-up could be accepted if the literature does not contain larger or longer studies.\nOAs submitted to the Journal of Orthopaedics and Traumatology have to be arranged in 5 sections: Abstract, Introduction, Materials and methods, Results and Discussion. A limit of 3500 words is far beyond the needs of most good papers [4].\nThe medical writing style, officially set by the Manual of Style of the American Medical Association, should be grammatically correct, clear and not redundant. In one word, essential. [5]\nAny possible conflict of interest has to be disclosed. Otherwise, the authors should clearly declare that no funds were received in support of the research that researchers had no financial interests related to it.\nAbstract # The abstract is the precise summary of the article, not a preface. As Baue wrote in a popular editorial of the Archives of Surgery in 1979, “writing a good abstract is not abstract writing” [6]. The main data have to be represented, as they allow readers to understand contents clearly. Sentences like “The paper reports\u0026hellip;” or “The authors describe\u0026hellip;” have to be avoided as well as any generic statements.\nIn order to help writers avoid generalities, the recently revised version of this journal’s “instructions to authors” [4] requires the abstract to be no longer than 300 words and structured in 4 paragraphs: the Background declares the hypothesis, the Materials and methods impart the study design and quote the relevant numerical features of the samples, the Results report the main data and their statistical significance, the Conclusions state whether the hypothesis is verified or not. One or two sentences per paragraph are usually sufficient.\nThe abstract is frequently recommended to be written after the text, as “the process of writing changes thought and perhaps even purpose” [7]. Nonetheless, in my view, preparing the abstract first is a useful exercise that forces the authors to organize their thoughts and guides the organization of the article. However, the abstract should be always revised after the manuscript has been completed.\nIntroduction # The Introduction is a critical section, as it needs to be finely balanced to allow a proper approach to the subject matter without anticipating the contents of the subsequent parts. Important topics of the Introduction are the state of the art and the hypothesis (or hypotheses). The state of the art should be briefly described with essential papers. Deeply commenting on a single reference is better postponed to the Discussion, since the purpose of this section is to inform, not to discuss.\nThe hypothesis has to be clearly expressed in the last paragraph, and its relevance should be logically deducible from the previous state of the art description. In other words, the Introduction aims at showing that a problem exists, and that previous investigations did not offer any adequate solutions, so justifying the reported research [8].\nMaterials and methods # This section should contain the detailed description of the study. The more careful this description is, the more reliable the results are.\nAs for clinical studies, the following contents cannot be omitted:\nDeclaration that the study was carried out in accordance with the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki [8], that it was approved by the institutional ethics committee and that all the patients gave informed consent to be enrolled. Study design. Is it a prospective or retrospective study? Is it a case-control study or a case series? Is it double-blinded, single-blinded or open?” Were the patients samples randomized or not? These are some of the questions that need to be answered here. Inclusion and exclusion criteria. Characteristics of the patients (mean age and range, male-to-female ratio, diagnoses, confounding variables, etc). Outcome measures (clinical variables, radiological variables, combined scores, etc) should be broadly accepted in the representative literature. In case of a different choice, this decision has to be justified. Statistical methods. Significance level (e.g. α = 0.05) and power (e.g. β = 0.8). As previously indicated, cases series regarding total joint replacement and malignant tumours need a survival analysis.\nResults # The purpose of this section is to provide numerical data without comments [10].\nClinical studies should always report the number of cases lost to follow-up. Variables have to be reported as averages and 95% confidence intervals. Units should be always indicated and abbreviated according to the metric or SI system. Frequencies (e.g. frequency of complications) have to be described both by absolute number and percentage, the latter being in parentheses, e.g. 6 (2.5%).\nIf the sample size is small (up to 20 cases), a detailed table is requested that displays the most remarkable measured variables of each case. Authors should remember that such a table ought to be available anyway, as referees might ask for it during the reviewing process.\nSince the aim of tables is to save space, they should be avoided if the same data may be presented more concisely in the text or if they just duplicate text contents.\nResults that are relevant to the hypothesis have to be associated with their statistical significance. The exact p value has to be reported close to “significant” or “non-significant”, while “p \u0026lt; α” cannot be accepted, as it does not allow readers to understand the true risk of type I error (the risk of observing a difference that does not exist) and reviewers to check the calculations.\nResults not relevant to the hypothesis have to be reported only if they show unexpected findings or might be useful for further investigations. Otherwise they will divert attention from the main results.\nDiscussion # The Discussion is the section in which previously reported results are discussed, not repeated nor summarized. Here, the author is asked to achieve four fundamental goals:\nCompare the study to the relevant literature, Acknowledge possible weak points, Draw conclusions about the hypothesis (verified or not), and State the clinical relevance of these results. The first task is obtained through a careful review of available studies regarding the subject matter, which should be briefly referred to in the text, without getting lost in excessively detailed analyses. Discrepancies and unexpected findings have to be explained, or at least attempted to be explained.\nThe second issue is an essential step of any scientific paper. Author who do not highlight limitations of their study (bias, short follow-up, small sample size, etc.) show superficiality and lack of self-criticism, so compromising their own credibility and reliability of the results.\nThe third point is the manuscript’s conclusion, where the authors are expected to state if the experimental hypothesis was verified or not on the basis of the results. This cannot stand alone without the fourth part, in which the clinical relevance of the conclusions are set forth.\nThe multiple issues of the Discussion usually make it a long section. Thus, authors should pay attention to avoid repetitions, redundancy and digressions.\nReferences # Every statement that is not proved by the results of the study nor can be logically drawn by a previous one needs to be supported by a specific reference. References should be pertinent and recent. No mentions to personal communications or to proceedings older than 3 years are permitted, in order to allow readers to consult the sources easily.\nUp to 50 references are permitted in OAs of the Journal of Orthopaedics and Traumatology. The authors should remember to check the intructions to authors for their structure and order of citation [4].\nSumming up # Writing an OA for the Journal of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, as for any other peer-reviewed journal, first requires a reliable study. Poorly posed hypotheses, badly planned study protocols, inaccurate data collection and wrong statistical analyses compromise the quality of the final manuscript much more than do writing errors, often irreversibly.\nOn the other hand, if a sound study was performed, transforming it into a good article is barely a matter of form. Although the suggestions provided here are intended to help authors with manuscripts preparation, an effective writing style is mainly an achievement of experience. The only way to shorten the learning curve is by reading. Every author and especially the future ones should keep in mind that the best medical writers are the most assiduous medical readers.\nReferences # McGaghie WC, Bordage G, Shea J (2001) Problem statement, conceptual framework, and research question.

The region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is considered a biogeographic source for multiple colonization events into adjacent areas including the northern Palearctic. The faunal exchange between the QTP and adjacent regions could thus represent a one-way street (“out of” the QTP). However, immigration into the QTP region has so far received only little attention, despite its potential to shape faunal and floral communities of the QTP. In this study, we investigated centers of origin and dispersal routes between the QTP, its forested margins and adjacent regions for five clades of alpine and montane birds of the passerine superfamily Passeroidea. We performed an ancestral area reconstruction using BioGeoBEARS and inferred a time-calibrated backbone phylogeny for 279 taxa of Passeroidea. The oldest endemic species of the QTP was dated to the early Miocene (ca. 20 Ma). Several additional QTP endemics evolved in the mid to late Miocene (12–7 Ma). The inferred centers of origin and diversification for some of our target clades matched the “out of Tibet hypothesis’ or the “out of Himalayas hypothesis” for others they matched the “into Tibet hypothesis.” Three radiations included multiple independent Pleistocene colonization events to regions as distant as the Western Palearctic and the Nearctic. We conclude that faunal exchange between the QTP and adjacent regions was bidirectional through time, and the QTP region has thus harbored both centers of diversification and centers of immigration.\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. © 2020 The Authors.

On the Eurasian continent, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) and its flanking mountain systems constitute the largest and probably most diverse area of montane species richness (Aliabadian, Sluys, Roselaar, \u0026amp; Nijman, 2008; Fjeldså et al., 2012). For example, passerine bird diversity follows a gradient from warm and humid forest ecosystems harboring 358 species in the Eastern Himalayas (Price et al., 2014) and 441 in northern Myanmar (Renner et al., 2015) toward less diverse avian communities in the colder and drier Western Himalayas (Price et al., 2011). Alpine avian communities on the QTP are generally less species rich than those of the Himalayan forest ecosystems (Fjeldså et al., 2012), however, they harbor a couple of wide-range and narrow-range endemics as well as widespread trans-Palearctic species (Figure 1).\nimage Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint\nFigure 1 Passerine bird species of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP); QTP endemics, wide distribution range on the plateau: (a) streaked rosefinch, Carpodacus rubicilloides; (b) robin accentor, Prunella rubeculoides; (c) rock sparrow, Petronia petronia, widespread trans-Palearctic distribution; (d) Tibetan bunting, Emberiza koslowi, narrow-range endemic of the QTP; all photos: M.P., Qinghai, China, June 2013\nThe three major hotspots of diversity at the QTP fringes are the Mountains of Central Asia in the West, the Himalayas in the South, and the Mountains of Southwest China (i.e., the Hengduanshan and its northward extensions) in the East (Figure 2a; Favre et al., 2015). As the largest and highest plateau on Earth, the QTP extends across a surface area of about 2.3 million km2, comprising the largest continuous area of montane grasslands of the World (Olson et al., 2001). The alpine environments of the QTP and its flanking mountain systems have been declared as the “Third Pole” (Yao et al., 2012). As such, the QTP recently became famous as the source area of cold-adapted organisms of the Eurasian fauna (e.g., the Pleistocene mammal fauna: Wang et al., 2015) or the Holarctic alpine flora (Favre et al., 2016). However, the “out of Tibet hypothesis” for the montane and alpine fauna and flora of Eurasia is not a particularly new concept, dating back to the work of the German ornithologist Hugo Weigold in the early 20th century. He was the first to postulate a Tibetan center of diversification (“Entwicklungszentrum”) for Palearctic terrestrial vertebrates, and earliest emergences of Tibetan faunal elements already during the Early Tertiary (Weigold, 1935, 1949, 2005). Weigold\u0026rsquo;s ideas fell into oblivion, until the out of Tibet hypothesis was reanimated in the discussion on the Tibetan origin of Palearctic cold-adapted mammals inferred from fossil evidence (Deng et al., 2011; Tseng, Li, \u0026amp; Wang, 2013; Tseng et al., 2014; Wang, Li, \u0026amp; Takeuchi, 2016; Wang, Tseng, Li, Takeuchi, \u0026amp; Xie, 2014). Some of these studies suggested a “Himalayan origin” (Wang et al., 2014) or “Central Asian origin” (Tseng et al., 2013) of their study organisms, but all these examples were later reviewed in the context of an “out of Tibet” colonization of the adjacent regions in the North (e.g., Qiu, 2014; Wang et al., 2015). Besides this terminological inaccuracy, the emerging view from analysis of the QTP fossil record was therefore a “one-way view” of faunal interchange between the QTP (including its margins; Figure 2a) and adjacent bioregions, excluding any reverse movement into Tibet (Tseng et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014, 2016).\nimage Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint\nFigure 2 (a) Target region, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (area 1) and the biodiversity hotspots along its forested margins (areas 2–5), modified from Favre et al. (2015); (b) phylogeny for 279 species of Passeroidea, five target clades representing five independent radiations involving QTP species marked in bold\nRecent phylogenetic studies have suggested or presumed a one-directional “out of Tibet” or a “out of Himalayas” dispersal pathway, too, but these were typically focusing on single species or a single, species-poor clade (e.g., Fuentes-Hurtado, Hof, \u0026amp; Jansson, 2016; Liu et al., 2017; Voelker, Semenov, Fadeev, Blick, \u0026amp; Drovetski, 2015; and other examples in Table S1). However, work on a larger taxonomic group (e.g., speciose alpine taxa like Saxifraga, Ebersbach et al., 2017) suggested that both in situ speciation and immigration played a key role in the evolution of alpine faunal and floral assemblages of the QTP (e.g., Hauenschild et al., 2017) or of the Himalayas (Johansson et al., 2007; compare Table S1).\nIn this study, we compare patterns of biogeographic history among five subclades of Passeroidea, a superfamily of passerine birds (Johansson, Fjeldså, \u0026amp; Bowie, 2008; Selvatti, Gonzaga, \u0026amp; de Morales Russo, 2015). These subclades represent five independent passerine radiations (Figure 2b), representing ideal model groups for the study of biogeographic history of QTP faunal assemblages: the studied species are montane and alpine birds distributed across all mountain systems of the Holarctic (Figure 3) and include 29 endemics to the QTP region. For these five passerine clades, biogeographic analyses and ancestral area reconstructions are either missing, incomplete, or provide contradictory results (Drovetski et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2017; Tietze, Päckert, Martens, Lehmann, \u0026amp; Sun, 2013).\nimage Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint\nFigure 3 Spatial distribution of species richness and diversity hotspots for all five target clades of Passeroidea; diversity heat maps were compiled with QGIS using shape files inferred from BirdLife International and NatureServe (2015) and from the IUCN Red List (2019); colors indicate regional species richness (high = red; low = dark blue)\nOur five studied passerine clades encompass characteristic faunal elements of the QTP region and include several lineages considered as flagship species by Weigold (2005) for the high alpine grasslands and rocky hillslopes of the QTP: (a) Old World sparrows (Passeridae) comprising snowfinches (Montifringilla and allies; two genera Onychostruthus and Pyrgilauda are endemic to this region). The area of high Passeridae species richness at the eastern margin of the QTP is certainly due to the high snowfinch diversity in this region (Figure 3a; a second hotspot in East Africa is characterized by a high diversity of Passer species), (b) the mountain finches (genus Leucosticte), with three species in the QTP region and further three in the Nearctic. This genus along with bullfinches and other allies belong to tribe Pyrrhulini (clade 6 in Zuccon, Prŷs-Jones, Rasmussen, \u0026amp; Ericson, 2012). With another group, (c) the rosefinches (Carpodacini: clade 5 in Zuccon et al., 2012), both tribes of finches (Fringillidae) have areas of highest species richness in the Sinohimalayas (Pyrrhulini also north of the QTP; Figure 3b,c). Weigold (2005) hypothesized that all extant rosefinches originated from a Tibetan ancestor but later diversified in peripheral refuges at the southern and the eastern QTP margin when forest habitats vanished from the central plateau region. Furthermore, we investigate (d) Old World buntings (Emberzidae). Although the hotspot of highest bunting species richness is located in the Eastern Palearctic, a few taxa form a secondary hotspot of species richness at the eastern QTP margin (Figure 3d). According to Weigold (2005) the endemic Tibetan bunting, Emberiza koslowi (Figure 1d) represents an “autochtonous faunal element” of the QTP (i.e., he assumed that this species originated in situ on the QTP), whereas the crested bunting (Emberiza lathami) had originated from a tropical ancestor southwest of the QTP. Finally, (e) accentors, in the Palearctic family Prunellidae, are most speciose at the northeastern and southeastern QTP margin (Figure 3e).\nOur five target clades encompassed 132 Holarctic species, including 29 endemics of the QTP and its forested margins (compare “Material and Methods,” “Species distributions”). Assuming an in situ origin of all QTP endemics that was associated with the supposedly recent formation of the plateau region (Liu, Gao, Chen, \u0026amp; Lu, 2002 and references therein), recent orogenetic processes should have promoted the rise of species-level lineages endemic to the QTP from the Middle Miocene on (Shang et al., 2015). However, such a tight coupling of young evolutionary events (species splits, adaptive radiations in the QTP region) with orogenetic post-Miocene events (“young Tibet hypothesis”) has recently been critically challenged by Renner (2016). Indeed, there is evidence of ancient QTP species that evolved prior to the Miocene (Baker, Pereira, \u0026amp; Paton, 2007; Päckert, Sun, et al., 2015). Furthermore, some ancient Tibetan and Himalayan faunal elements already emerged during the Eocene and later diversified in situ on the QTP over a long period of time (Martens, 2015; Mosbrugger, Favre, Muellner-Riehl, Päckert, \u0026amp; Mulch, 2018 and references therein). These findings are in accordance with Weigold’s (2005) theory of an early Tertiary origin of the endemic fauna of Tibet, though he was originally driven by the idea that diversification of the Tibetan fauna was firmly associated with the uplift of the QTP.\nIn accordance with Weigold\u0026rsquo;s theories and with more complex biogeographic patterns derived from large phylogenies and comparison across clades, we searched for evidence of ancestral areas of origin for our target groups on the QTP itself and along its margins (Figure 2a), and also in adjacent regions beyond the QTP region. We therefore provide one of very few case studies that compare patterns of biogeographical history across different clades from a speciose monophyletic group of organisms.\n2 MATERIALS AND METHODS # 2.1 Sampling strategy # Biogeographic inferences for our five target clades needed to be anchored within a broader biogeographic scenario, including a broad selection of closely related as well as distant clades. We therefore assembled a DNA sequence dataset for Passeroidea, a highly speciose crown clade of Passeriformes that comprises 25 avian families (see Figure S1; Table S2). For all our target clades, our taxon sampling was 100% or near 100% (missing only Montifringilla theresae from Central Asia and Carpodacus sillemi from the QTP). We furthermore included a few subspecific taxa that are currently not accepted as “good species” but nevertheless represent distinct resident lineages (Table S2). These subspecies-level taxa represented vicariants occurring in different regions of a species’ range (in Eurasia our areas B–H) and in some species, distinct subspecific lineages correspond to distinct phenotypes, like in the common bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula: Töpfer et al., 2010). Divergence times between all these subspecific taxa equal or even exceed the minimum divergence times estimated for a good species pair of the target clade they are nested in. These species pairs are as follows: (a) for snowfinches Pyrgilauda davidiana/P. blanfordi (Delgado, Bettega, Martens, \u0026amp; Päckert, 2019); (b) for Carpodacini Carpodacus rubicilloides (Figure 1a)/C. rubicilla and C. thura/C. dubius (Tietze et al., 2013); (c) for Pyrrhulini Leucosticte tephrocotis/L. australis/L. atrata (Drovetski, Zink, \u0026amp; Mode, 2009); (d) for buntings: Emberiza hortulana/E. caesia and E. citrinella/E. leucocephalos (Päckert, Sun, et al., 2015); (e) Prunellidae: Prunella ocularis/P. fagani (Liu et al., 2017).\n2.2 DNA extraction, PCR, and sequencing # To complete taxon sampling and coverage of loci for our target clades, we used samples and DNA extracts available from previous analyses (Päckert, Sun, et al., 2015; Päckert, Martens, Sun, \u0026amp; Strutzenberger, 2016; Tietze et al., 2013; Töpfer et al., 2011; for newly generated sequences see Table S2). We extracted DNA from new samples using Qiagen blood and tissue kits according to the manufacturer\u0026rsquo;s instructions. Our sequence data set included four loci: the mitochondrial cytochrome-b (cytb) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2), as well as the nuclear introns ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) intron 7, and myoglobin (myo) intron 2. Overall, we used general and previously published primers (for PCR and sequencing primer combinations and PCR settings see Table S3). However, we utilized taxon-specific primer pairs for PCR and sequencing of ND2 for Passeridae by Belkacem et al. (2016) and of ODC for rosefinch and bunting samples (Table S3). We purified PCR products using ExoSap-IT (GE Healthcare; adding 0.1 ml ExoSap-IT solution in 4 ml H2O to each sample; PCR settings: 37°C for 30 min, 94°C for 15 min) and sequenced the purified PCR products, which was performed with BigDyeTM 3.1 Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kits (Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Sequencing products were purified by salt/ethanol precipitation or by using Sephadex (GE Healthcare), and sequenced in both directions on an ABI 3130xl DNA sequencer.\n2.3 Data assembly # Sequences for core target taxa were compiled from previous studies (n = 101 species analyzed in Päckert et al., 2016; further taxa added from Tietze et al., 2013 and Päckert, Sun, et al., 2015). We added missing species and filled gaps in sequence coverage with newly generated sequences. To have all families of Passeroidea represented by at least one species, we included further sequences from GenBank. This is in accordance with Cai et al. (2018) who emphasized that estimates of ancestral range for ingroups (i.e., our target clades) are strongly affected by the ranges of outgroups (i.e., sister clades of our target clades). We added two passerine outgroup species: Bombycilla garrulus (Bombycilloidea as the sister clade of Passerida) and Acanthisitta chloris (Acanthisittidae as the earliest offshoot of the Passeriformes) and three further nonpasserine outgroup taxa (Table S2). Newly generated sequences were joined with sequences obtained from previous studies and sorted using the R package “ape” (Paradis, Claude, \u0026amp; Strimmer, 2004; Paradis \u0026amp; Schliep, 2019). Sequences were assembled using custom scrips in R (R Development Core Team, 2016) and aligned with the stand-alone version of MAFFT 7.273 (Katoh \u0026amp; Standley, 2013) with automatic selection of the appropriate alignment strategy, the scoring matrix set to “200PAM/κ = 2,” and the gap opening penalty set to 1.53 (with a gap extension penalty of 0.123). The obtained sequence alignments were manually checked for errors. The total sequence alignment had a length of 4,813 bp and totaled 281 taxa.\nAll newly generated sequences have been deposited at GenBank under the following accession numbers: MT210104–M210119 (cytb), MT210120–MT210147 (ND2), MT277429–MT277443 (myo), and MT336176–MT336215 (ODC).\n2.4 Phylogenetic reconstruction and divergence-time estimation # Phylogenetic inference and divergence-time estimation were performed with BEAST v1.8.2 (Drummond, Suchard, Xie, \u0026amp; Rambaut, 2012). We partitioned our dataset in accordance with the best-fitting partitioning scheme that resulted from PartitionFinder v1.1.1 (Lanfear, Calcott, Ho, \u0026amp; Guindon, 2012) with all site models unlinked and one clock model for each gene resulting in a total of eight sites and four clock models. The search for the best strategy relied on the “beast” model-set and heuristic search. We linked all tree models to one tree model and a birth–death tree prior was applied. As initial condition for the BEAST run, we supplied a starting tree calculated with RAxML v8.2.0 (Stamatakis, 2014). Search for the best-known likelihood tree was performed with 100 replicates, bootstrap values obtained from a thorough bootstrap run using the autoMRE option (Pattengale, Alipour, Bininda-Emonds, More, \u0026amp; Stamatakis, 2010) were annotated onto the best-known likelihood tree. All analyses were performed using the same partitioning scheme as applied for BEAST analyses with the GTRGAMMA model applied to all partitions. The BEAST run was performed using the BEAGLE v2.3 library with a chain length of 1.1 × 108 generations with trees being sampled every 10,000 generations. The chain was inspected for convergence and sufficient ESS values (\u0026gt;200) with Tracer v1.6 (Rambaut \u0026amp; Drummond, 2007). Trees were summarized with TreeAnnotator v1.8.2, where median heights were annotated to the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree.\nWe used eight calibration points in order to obtain estimates for node ages (modified from Päckert et al., 2016; see Table S4). Additionally, we applied a normal prior to the root age to avoid the occurrence of implausibly old root ages. Instead of using hard boundaries, we adopted a “soft boundary” strategy where the desired calibration is achieved by setting priors in such a way that 97.5% of the probability density lie within the desired minimum and maximum boundaries (Benton, Donoghue, \u0026amp; Asher, 2009). All calibrated nodes were forced to be monophyletic. Sequence alignments and tree files are deposited at Dryad under https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.xksn02vd0.\n2.5 Species distributions # As basis of our biogeographic analysis, we delineated eight regions (see maps in Figures 3-7 with the New World as region A). Those areas, located outside the QTP region, were designed to loosely follow the classic biogeographic realms and zoogeographical boundaries (Ficetola, Mazel, \u0026amp; Thuiller, 2017), as done in other studies (e.g., Favre et al., 2016). We divided our target region into the high alpine Tibetan plateau (area E; Figure 2a: region 1) and two major flanking mountain systems: (a) the Central Asian Mountains in the West (area D; Figure 2a: region 2) and (b) the Sinohimalayas comprising the Himalayas (Figure 2a: region 3) and the Hengduanshan (Figure 2a: region 4) in the South and Southeast (area F). The Sinohimalayas represent one of three major global hotspots of avian diversity (e.g., Cai et al., 2018) with a high richness of both ancient and recent species (together with the Andes and the mountains of the African Arc; Fjeldså et al., 2012). Among 29 species endemic to the QTP region, ten species were present in only one area: four on the Tibetan Plateau [Figure 2a: area 1], three in the Himalayas [Figure 2a: area 3], two in the Hengduanshan [Figure 2a: area 4] and one in the Central Asian Mountains [Figure 2a: area 2]. Furthermore, our target groups comprise nineteen endemic species present in two or more areas of the QTP region (Figure 2a), among them four species which are endemic to the Sinohimalayas.\nimage Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint\nFigure 4 “Out of Tibet” dispersal of snowfinches (Montifringilla, Onychostruthus, Pyrgilauda) and rock sparrows (Petronia), only the respective clade of the time-calibrated Passeroidea MCC tree is shown; node support from Bayesian inference of phylogeny (BI) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) indicated by symbols explained above the tree (no symbol for support values below 0.95/80); biogeographical reconstruction based on a dispersal–extinction–cladogenesis (DEC) model; letters at nodes show best states, pie charts show per-area probabilities inferred from ARR2 (nine areas); main dispersal events sketched on the map including area codes (right); color codes for most frequent ancestral area combinations below map (right); extant patterns of sympatry on the QTP shown on maps below for (a) small snowfinches, three Pyrgilauda species and one Onychostruthus species (BirdLife International and NatureServe, 2015); (b) large species of Montifringilla (Asian distributions of M. nivalis and M. henrici according to Gebauer et al., 2006)\nimage Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint\nFigure 5 “Out of Himalaya” dispersal of rosefinches (Carpodacus; only the respective clade of the time-calibrated Passeroidea MCC tree is shown); node support from Bayesian inference of phylogeny (BI) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) indicated by symbols explained above the tree (no symbol for support values below 0.95/80); biogeographical reconstruction based on a dispersal–extinction–cladogenesis model (DEC); letters at nodes show best states, pie charts show per-area probabilities inferred from ARR2 (nine areas); main dispersal events sketched on the map including area codes (right); color codes for most frequent ancestral area combinations below map (right)\nimage Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint\nFigure 6 “Out of Himalaya” dispersal of mountain finches (Leucosticte) and allies (only the respective clade of the time-calibrated Passeroidea MCC tree is shown); node support from Bayesian inference of phylogeny (BI) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) indicated by symbols explained above the tree (no symbol for support values below 0.95/80); biogeographical reconstruction based on a dispersal–extinction–cladogenesis model (DEC); letters at nodes show best states, pie charts show per-area probabilities inferred from ARR2 (nine areas); main dispersal events sketched on the map including area codes (right); color codes for most frequent ancestral area combinations below map (right)\nimage Figure 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint\nFigure 7 “Into Tibet” dispersal of Old World buntings (Emberiza, four clades I-IV indicated in gray boxes; only the respective clade of the time-calibrated Passeroidea MCC tree is shown); node support from Bayesian inference of phylogeny (BI) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) indicated by symbols explained above the tree (no symbol for support values below 0.95/80); biogeographical reconstruction based on a dispersal–extinction–cladogenesis model (DEC); letters at nodes show best states, pie charts show per-area probabilities inferred from ARR2 (nine areas); main dispersal events sketched on the map including area codes (right); color codes for most frequent ancestral area combinations below map (right)\nWe used QGIS v2.4 (QGIS Development Team, 2014) to draw shapefiles representing the maximum nine geographic regions in our analysis. We established a workflow for automated extraction of bird distributional ranges, using bird distribution data provided by BirdLife International and NatureServe (2015) in ESRI shapefile format. Geographic ranges encoded in BirdLife International (BLI) shapefiles were filtered to only represent year-round and breeding ranges of natively occurring species according to three types of distribution encoded in the attribute table of a shapefile. A species’ range was therefore reduced to those polygons corresponding to the following categories: type presence: extant; type origin: native; type seasonality: resident and breeding season. Subsequently, a dissolve operation was applied in QGIS to join all separate features for each species resulting in each species being represented by a single polygon feature. The intersection function (QGIS) was then used to obtain a list of all intersections between the geographic area polygons and the bird distribution polygons. The resulting list was converted to a matrix using the “xtabs” function (Rbase) and the “as.matrix.xtabs” command (DescTools).\nIn a second step, we made manual corrections to the area matrix for a couple of reasons. First, our data set included two species recognized by Clements et al. (2015) but not by BLI (i.e., their distributions were included in shape files of other species). These were as follows: Montifringilla henrici [listed as subspecies of M. nivalis by BLI; distribution corrected according to Gebauer, Eck, Kaiser, Lei, and Martens (2006) and Martens and Eck (2003) see Figure 4b]; C. formosanus [listed as ssp. of C. vinaceus by BLI]; this species occurs only on Taiwan [included in our area H]; for distinctiveness of C. formosanus according to an integrative taxonomic approach compare Wu et al., 2011). Second, based on modeled species distributions Ramesh, Gopalakrishna, Barve, and Melnick (2017) has raised the concern that for narrow-range endemics, BirdLife International shape files might overestimate the true extent of distribution range. However, their study was limited to the regional avifauna of the Western Ghats and we consider these deviations between projected BLI distributions and modeled distributions (Ramesh et al., 2017) of minor importance for our transcontinental study (even our two smallest areas the Himalayas and the Hengduanshan are 1.7–3.7 times larger than the Western Ghats). Furthermore, other studies suggested a good accordance of potential distribution models (PDMs) and BLI distributions for several Mexican bird species (Ortega-Huerta \u0026amp; Vega-Rivera, 2017). Nevertheless, we took into account that automatic extraction of species ranges from BLI shape files might cause false-positive occurrence of a species in an area with only marginal overlap at the very margins of its breeding range (examples of Carpodacus rosefinches are shown in Figure S2). Because we consider this a potential bias of our automatic extraction of bird ranges from BirdLife shapefiles, we deleted these marginal areas from the area matrix. We cross-checked our area classification with published range maps in the Atlas of Palearctic Breeding Birds (for example for rosefinches, Carpodacini, in Martens \u0026amp; Sun, 2008) as was done in previous studies (e.g., Drovetski et al., 2013) (further atlas volumes consulted: Dathe \u0026amp; Loskot, 1992; Stresemann \u0026amp; Portenko, 1960, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1980, 1981; Stresemann, Portenko, \u0026amp; Mauersberger, 1971; Stresemann, Portenko, Dathe, \u0026amp; Mauersberger, 1974). Our final area matrix is included in our data package deposited at Dryad under https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.xksn02vd0.\n2.6 Ancestral-range reconstruction (ARR) # We used R package BioGeoBEARS (Matzke, 2013) for ancestral-range reconstruction (ARR). The maximum clade credibility tree obtained from BEAST was used as input tree (we kept the waxwing, B. garrulus, as the closest outgroup of Passeroidea and pruned all further outgroups used for fossil calibration from the input tree shown in Figure S1). We fitted the dispersal, extinction, and cladogenesis (DEC) model to the time-calibrated Passeroidea tree (for further details, see Appendix S5). We used a “dispersal multipliers” matrix, allowing dispersal between all areas, favoring adjacent ones (1.0), but penalizing slightly (0.5) dispersal between nonadjacent areas interconnected by a third one (in a land continuum), and penalizing strongly (0.01) long distance dispersal between very distant continents (e.g., Europe and the New World; see Tables S5a,b).\nWe performed two alternative runs with BioGeoBEARS: one with the Sinohimalayas classified as a single area F (ARR1; Figure S3) and a second run with the Himalayas and the Hengduanshan as two separate areas (F1, F2; ARR2) with the Mekong-Salween divide as one of the main geographic barriers (compare Liu et al., 2016; Päckert et al., 2012). Separate treatment of these two mountain regions also takes into consideration the different orogenetic histories and the younger age of the Hengduanshan (Favre et al., 2015; and references therein). Dispersal multipliers were adjusted to the latter analyses with eight and nine areas, respectively (Tables S5a,b). Our final dispersal multiplier matrices were included in our data package deposited at Dryad under https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.xksn02vd0.\n3 RESULTS # 3.1 Phylogeny and origin of Passeroidea # Phylogenetic analyses with BEAST and RAxML resulted in largely congruent topologies for the major families of Passeroidea (Figure S1; autoMRE bootstrap converged after 200 replicates). Among all Passeroidea, Przevalski\u0026rsquo;s finch, Urocynchramus pylzowi, represented the oldest species-level lineage endemic to the QTP (Figure S3). The split from its sister group (Ploceidae) was dated to a mean age of 20 Ma [16.4–24.7 Ma], which corresponds to the onset of the diversification for all our five target clades (see below). All fourteen endemic species of the QTP region (that occurred in a single area, including four Sinohimalayan endemics) emerged during the late Miocene (e.g., Tibetan bunting, E. koslowi) or early Pleistocene (e.g., Tibetan Snowfinch, M. henrici).\nIn ARR1 and ARR2, area uncertainty was high at the basal nodes of the Passeroidea tree, however, best states suggested a Holarctic ancestral range of Passeroidea (Afrotropics and Oriental region were not included in the ancestral range; Figure S3). In contrast, for several suprageneric clades, ancestral ranges were limited to one region only, for example, a Nearctic origin of “Emberizoidea” sensu Barker, Burns, Klicka, Lanyon, and Lovette (2013) (see Figure S1) and Fringillidae (see Figure S3).\n3.2 Biogeographical history of montane and alpine target groups of Passeroidea # We found contrasting areas of diversification and dispersal routes between the QTP and adjacent regions for our five target clades. Generally, there was large congruence between reconstructions based on eight areas (ARR1) and nine areas (ARR2), respectively. Separate classification of the Himalayas and the Hengduanshan as two areas F1 and F2 (ARR2) often resulted in ancestral ranges with highest per-area probabilities in either of the two regions (at nodes with an ancestral range in the Sinohimalayas in ARR1; Figures S3 and S4). In the following, we present and discuss the results from ARR2 based on nine areas and refer to deviations among ARRs only in the one case that showed an effect of the total number of areas on area uncertainty.\nA QTP origin (area E) was recovered for snowfinches and rock sparrows (Figure 4), with a mean root age estimate of 12.4 [9.9–15.3] Ma for the onset of their radiation. For their sister clade (Old World sparrows of genera Passer and Gymnoris) an African area of origin was estimated (best state and highest per-area probabilities). Genus Passer includes several widespread species whose ranges extend into the QTP region (Figures S3 and S4), however, none of these would represent a QTP endemic that had colonized the QTP from elsewhere. Two main clades of snowfinches (Pyrgilauda, small species; Montifringilla, large species) separated at about 7.6 [6.0–9.6] Ma. Area E was the best state and had highest per-area probabilities at most nodes of the snowfinch clade. Only for the ancestral range of small Pyrgilauda species, the Sinohimalayas had the highest per-area probabilities in ARR2 (two areas F1, F2, whereas from ARR1 again area E resulted as best state for the ancestral range of Pyrgilauda). The Montifringilla clade included the only snowfinch species that during the late Pleistocene dispersed as far as to the Western Palearctic (M. nivalis; Figure 4).\nAreas of origin and diversification in the QTP region were also reconstructed for both our target clades of finches (Fringillidae). The onset of rosefinch (Carpodacini) radiation was dated to 11.2 [9.5–13.3] Ma and involved major centers of diversification on the QTP (area E) and in the Sinohimalayas (areas F1 and F2; Figure 5). Their sister clade, the Hawaiian Honeycreepers (Drepanidini), represents a solely Nearctic group. Two larger rosefinch clades diversified in different areas of the QTP region: Clade I comprised 15 species that diversified in the Himalayas (highest or high per-area probabilities for area F1 at five nodes; Sinohimalayas best state; Figure 5, Figure S3). The Himalayan rosefinch radiation included one early dispersal event to Central Asia (area D) and a more recent dispersal event to southern China and Taiwan (area H; Figure 5). For the second major rosefinch clade II, comprising ten species, area E had the highest per-area probabilities at the two successively basal nodes (Figure 5). However, at several nodes of that second clade, the Hengduanshan (area F2) had highest (or high) per-area probabilities or was recovered as best state (Figure 5). Both groups included a terminal Pleistocene dispersal event to the Western Palearctic (area B; Figure 5: clade I, C. rubicilla; clade II: C. synoicus).\nA Himalayan origin was reconstructed for another finch clade, Pyrrhulini, that comprised the mountain finches of genus Leucosticte, bullfinches of genus Pyrrhula and allies from five other genera (Figure 6; highest per-area probabilities for area F1, and best state F1 at several clades). Pyrrhulini are sister to a diverse group of finches (tribe Carduelini) that among others includes several subclades restricted to the New World or to the Afrotropics (Figure S3). The high per-area probability for a New World origin of Carduelini (Figure 6) is certainly due to the basal split leading to the Nearctic house finch clade (genus Haemorhous; Figure S3). One Tibeto-Himalayan endemic, the Tibetan serin (Serinus thibetanus), emerged from the Carduelini clade, sister to a New World clade of siskins (Figure S3: the Eurasian siskin, Spinus spinus, belongs to this clade and has very likely colonized the Palearctic from the New World). Strikingly, this Tibeto-Himalayan endemic does not have any close phylogenetic relationship with other QTP species. The onset of Pyrrhulini diversification was dated to a mean age of 12.3 [10.2–14.4] Ma and their radiation also included a very recent terminal dispersal event of mountain finches (Leucosticte) into the Nearctic (area A1; Figure 6). The entire Himalayan finch group belonged to a larger finch clade, for which a Central Asian ancestral range was inferred (highest per-area probabilities for area D or DF).\nIn the buntings (Emberiza) several extant taxa from the QTP were nested within two larger clades that did not originate and diversify in the QTP region. Their sister group is represents a New World clade, the Passerellidae (Figure 7). An Eastern Palearctic center of origin and diversification was unanimously assigned to a clade comprising sixteen species including the Chinese endemic E. siemsseni and further distinct subspecific lineages of East Asian species (Figure 7, clade IV). Breeding ranges of all QTP taxa of clade IV are mainly restricted to the Hengduanshan (area F2 and parts of the adjacent QTP, area E; Figure 7). The ancestral area of clade II was equivocal (many combinations with low per-area probabilities at the two successively basal nodes; Figure 7). The Tibetan bunting (E. koslowi) was one of three early offshoots of clade II (mean split age 9.1 [7.5–10.9] Ma) and the QTP (area E) was recovered as the ancestral range at that node (highest per-area probabilities and best state; Figure 7).\nThe onset of accentor (Prunella) radiation was dated to 11.9 [9.4–14.7] Ma. The area origin of accentors (Prunella) was highly equivocal (low per-area probabilities for any combination of regions); however, area E (high QTP) was recovered as best state in both ARRs (Figure 8). For the basal nodes, there was less area uncertainty, when the Sinohimalayas were coded as a single area (a total of eight areas in ARR1 instead of nine in ARR2). According to ARR2, the QTP (area E) was the ancestral range of the accentor crown clade with highest per-area probabilities (Figure 8).\nimage Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint\nFigure 8 “Out of Tibet” dispersal of accentors (Prunella; only the respective clade of the time-calibrated Passeroidea MCC tree is shown); node support from Bayesian inference of phylogeny (BI) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) indicated by symbols explained above the tree (no symbol for support values below 0.95/80); biogeographical reconstruction based on a dispersal–extinction–cladogenesis model (DEC); letters at nodes show best states, pie charts show per-area probabilities inferred from ARR2 (nine areas; plus those from ARR1 with eight areas and less uncertainty at the three basal nodes); main dispersal events sketched on the map including area codes (right); color codes for most frequent ancestral area combinations below map (right)\n4 DISCUSSION # 4.1 Phylogeny and biogeographic history of Passeroidea # Our Passeroidea tree is in good accordance with previously published phylogenies, most of them based on a less dense taxon sampling (Barker et al., 2013; Davis \u0026amp; Page, 2014; Johansson et al., 2008; Jønsson \u0026amp; Fjeldsa, 2006). The timing of lineage splits inferred from our fossil dating approach is in accordance with other dated phylogenies (Barker et al., 2013; Claramunt \u0026amp; Cracraft, 2015; Moyle et al., 2016). Our ancestral-range reconstructions suggested a Holarctic origin of Passeroidea, whereas previous studies have suggested either a Palearctic origin (Claramunt \u0026amp; Cracraft, 2015) or an Indomalayan origin (Moyle et al., 2016) of this group. The latter difference is striking, as both studies applied the same global area coding. For our data set, uncertainty of ancestral ranges increased with the number of global areas classified (eight and nine) as illustrated for accentors, Prunellidae (Figure 8). Though previous studies on the biogeographical history of this family relied on even fewer areas (four and six), they predicted a rather broad ancestral range across the entire QTP region (Drovetski et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2017). Apart from different reconstruction methods, deviations between our results and those of the two latter studies might be due to different classifications of global areas on the one hand, and different delimitation of species distribution ranges on the other hand (e.g., inclusion or exclusion of the Himalayan nonbreeding range of Prunella himalayana). Thus, the outcome of ancestral area reconstructions might not only depend on the models applied (Clark et al., 2008; Pirie, Humphreys, Antonelli, Galley, \u0026amp; Linder, 2012) and different reconstruction methods (Johansson, Nylinder, Ohlson, \u0026amp; Tietze, 2018; Tietze et al., 2013), but also the area-coding approach. This has to be kept in mind for the discussion of the following evolutionary trajectories that we identified for our five Eurasian montane and alpine target clades.\n4.2 “Out of QTP”—in situ diversification on the QTP and along its forested fringes # Our results suggested a late Miocene origin (at about 8 Ma) and in situ diversification on the QTP and along its margins for snowfinches and for rosefinches of clade II. At the same time, ancestors of the major accentor clades dispersed “out of a Tibet” (area E) to a wide ancestral range including Central Asia and the Northern Palearctic (areas DEFG). There, ancestral lineages of accentors appear to have diversified from the late Miocene onward. In these three examples, that early phase of their radiation (8–5 Ma) coincides with a period of global climate cooling toward the end of the Miocene (reviews in Favre et al., 2015; Mosbrugger et al., 2018), with an intensification of Asian winter monsoon (Holbourn et al., 2018) and increasing aridification of the QTP (Miao et al., 2019; but compare Nie et al., 2017 for a warmer and wetter Miocene climate in the QTP region). Along with a decrease of birch and oak forests and a continuous change toward steppe vegetation on the northern QTP from 8.5 Ma on (Chen \u0026amp; Yang, 2016; Hui et al., 2011), new semiopen plateau habitats could have represented an evolutionary opportunity for the ancestors of extant QTP rosefinches, snowfinches, and accentors.\nAdaptive radiations on the QTP appear to have followed general ecogeographic rules. For example, smaller species of snowfinches (Pyrgilauda) diversified at the southern QTP margins, whereas larger species (Montifringilla) did so at higher latitudes, in the northern QTP margins. Similar accordance to Bergmann\u0026rsquo;s rule (Bergmann, 1847) was found along a latitudinal gradient on the QTP in small mammals such as pikas (Lin, Ci, Zhang, \u0026amp; Su, 2008) and zokors (Zhang, Nevo, Tang, Su, \u0026amp; Lin, 2012).\nIn the final Holocene phase of alpine passerine radiations, postglacial range expansion resulted in patterns of wide-range sympatry on the QTP, where today extant endemics occupy different ecological niches of the alpine meadows and grasslands. Snowfinch species of the QTP belong to two different ecological guilds with different habitat preferences for vertical or horizontal habitat complexity (Li et al., 2018). Similarly, all sympatric accentor (Prunella) species of the high alpine habitats on the QTP and its margins differ strikingly from each other in habitat preferences and in morphology (Drovetski et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2017). Only a few snowfinch and rosefinch species have colonized alpine habitats of central and western Palearctic mountain systems according to the “out of Tibet” hypothesis (e.g., M. nivalis) during the Pleistocene. Likewise, the (Sino-)Himalayas have been considered a source area of Holarctic montane organisms (Favre et al., 2016; Matuszak, Muellner-Riehl, Sun, \u0026amp; Favre, 2016; Pisano et al., 2016; Wen, Zhang, Nie, Zhong, \u0026amp; Sun, 2014) and “out of Himalayas” colonization in our target groups was suggested for the transcontinental colonization of Nearctic mountain systems from a Himalayan area of origin in mountain finches (Leucosticte; this study). A single rosefinch species emerged from dispersal out of the Himalayas to a subtropical region, that is, C. formosanus on Taiwan. Though none of the five radiations of montane Passeroidea reached into tropical regions (except of one bullfinch species, Pyrrhula leucogenis, on the Philippines), other clades of Passeroidea encompass tropical radiations across Southeast Asia (including the Sinohimalayas) such as those of sunbirds and flowerpeckers (Nectariniidae, Aethopgya: Hosner, Nyári, \u0026amp; Moyle, 2013; Dicaeidae: Nyári, Peterson, Rice, \u0026amp; Moyle, 2009). The Sinohimalayas were also considered the area of origin and in situ diversification of babblers, a highly diverse passerine group that from the early Miocene on colonized the entire Old World including the Tropics where regions of great babbler diversity can be found today (Cai et al., 2020).\nMoreover, biogeographic scenarios reconstructed for Passeroidea did not only include faunal interchange among the QTP and adjacent regions but also within the QTP region itself (e.g., exchange between areas D, E, and F).\n4.3 Faunal exchange between the plateau region and the QTP fringes # The discussion about processes fostering diversification within the QTP region has often been limited to phylogeographic patterns, that is, intraspecific genetic divergence as a result of Pleistocene range shifts to glacial refuges along its margins and successive Holocene range expansion (e.g., Lei, Qu, \u0026amp; Song, 2014; Yang, Dong, \u0026amp; Lei, 2009). This particular evolutionary scenario was recently summarized in the “contraction/recolonization” hypothesis by Muellner-Riehl (2019). However, for several of the Tibetan radiations during the Ice Ages also “platform refugia” and “microrefugia” (Muellner-Riehl, 2019) might explain the current patterns of sympatry and parapatry, such as for rosefinches of the Carpodacus pulcherrimus complex (this study, Figure 5; Tietze et al., 2013). Moreover, faunal exchange between the plateau and its peripheral forested mountain regions must have already occurred prior to the Pleistocene. The scenario of in situ diversification in the Himalayas for two finch clades (rosefinches: Figure 5; mountain finches and allies: Figure 6) suggested a major phase of diversification from 10 to 5 Ma that coincides with a period of accelerated elevational niche divergence of Himalayan passerines that reached its peak in the late Pliocene (Price et al., 2014). Along with the establishment of elevational parapatry, the Carpodacus rosefinch radiation involved multiple independent “into Tibet” movements, that is, colonizations of the plateau (area E) from its forested fringes (areas F1 and F2). These were associated with independent colonizations of semiopen and open alpine habitats from ancestral forest habitats (Päckert, Martens, Sun, \u0026amp; Tietze, 2015). In other alpine groups of organisms, there is evidence of the reverse directionality of faunal exchange, that is, from the central plateau to its margins. Indeed, the ancestors of a few Himalayan faunal elements seem to have originated from a Tibetan source area. With increasing aridification and loss of mesophilic forests on the QTP, these Tibetan stem populations dispersed southward into the “Himalayan exile” (area F1) where they later diversified as documented for lazy toads (Hoffmann et al., 2017) and ground beetles (Schmidt, Opgenoorth, Höll, \u0026amp; Bastrop, 2012; further examples in Martens, 2015).\n4.4 Immigration into the QTP region from adjacent source regions # The alpine QTP fauna and flora includes some immigrants from distant regions like the Nearctic (alpine plants: Ebersbach et al., 2017) and the Mediterranean (Clewing, von Oheimb, Vinarski, Wilke, \u0026amp; Albrecht, 2014; Wen et al., 2014), whereas the Himalayan bird communities were apparently shaped by immigration from adjacent subtropical areas in Southeast Asia (Johansson et al., 2007; Päckert et al., 2012).\nAmong our target groups, some Old World buntings (Emberiza) have colonized the eastern plateau margin from a center of origin and diversification northeast of the QTP (area G; similar scenario with higher area uncertainty for bullfinches). Weigold (2005) already supposed that those immigrants from the Northeast were already preadapted to cold and dry environments, given their presumed origin in the arid belt of Central Asian steppes and deserts. Further examples of Eastern Palearctic taxa on the QTP are found in rodents (Li \u0026amp; Wang, 2015). Also, depending on the perspective, the “Out of North China” hypothesis by Zhang et al. (2006) for Asian salamanders (Hynobiidae) can be regarded as an “into Tibet” dispersal. In northern China, successive cyclical vegetation shifts between steppe and forest (or grassland and desert) ecosystems during the Pliocene (Wang et al., 2006), might have furthermore promoted north–south faunal interchange at the eastern QTP margin (Päckert et al., 2012). Only a few of these Eastern Palearctic immigrants actually colonized the Himalayas (two bullfinch species for example; this study), thus these East Siberian/Mongolian taxa are characteristic for the montane and alpine ecosystems of the Hengduanshan (our area F2), that is, the eastern QTP margin.\nSeveral authors hypothesized that, as opposed to “centers of origin,” an area can constitute a “center of accumulation,” that is, a region that obtained taxa through unidirectional immigration from different source areas (Goldberg, Roy, Lande, \u0026amp; Jablonski, 2005; Mora, Chittaro, Sale, Kritzer, \u0026amp; Ludsin, 2003). As an equivalent term, an “immigration center” in the Sinohimalayas was suggested by Liu et al. (2017), however, the authors pointed out that evolutionary history of the regional avifauna was shaped by both in situ speciation and immigration. Also, Martens (2015) emphasized that biogeographic affinities of the Himalayas are manifold and during its long uplift history the Himalayan Arc and its extensions in the East did “not merely absorb” immigrant faunal elements from adjacent regions.\n5 CONCLUSION # Researchers of the early 20th century had already developed clear-sighted hypotheses on centers of origin and diversification in the QTP region as well as on a Tibetan immigrant mammal fauna from cold and arid environments north of the QTP (Weigold, 1949). This is all the more impressive, because these early biogeographic hypotheses were formulated in times prior to the application of cladistic methods or phylogenetic analysis of molecular data. Our analysis suggests that, in accordance with Weigold\u0026rsquo;s predictions, centers of origin and (in situ) diversification of extant QTP passerine bird genera were not restricted the QTP platform, but also occurred along its southern and southeastern margins (in the Himalayas and the Hengduanshan), and northeast of the QTP in the Eastern Palearctic. Faunal interchange among the QTP, its flanking mountains, and the adjacent regions must therefore have been a bidirectional process rather than a one-way street (for birds: Cai et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2016; for alpine plants: Ebersbach et al., 2017).\nPrevious biogeographical studies already acknowledged the fact that faunal interchange between adjacent bioregions in other parts of the world is a “two-way traffic” (Cheetham, 1963), such as the Great American Biotic Interchange. Although it has been assumed that faunal interchange across the Isthmus of Panama for birds went primarily from south to north (Weir, Bermingham, \u0026amp; Schluter, 2009), recent studies suggested that transcontinental dispersal and colonization of new habitat occurred in both directions (Pelegrin, Gamboa, Menéndez, \u0026amp; Hernández-Fernández, 2018; Woodburne, 2010). As a result, extant Neotropical faunal assemblages are composed by both native and immigrant taxa (Cione, Gasparini, Soibelzon, Soibelzon, \u0026amp; Tonni, 2015) and this is what Weigold (2005) suggested for the Tibetan avifauna, too. The same pattern of a bidirectional faunal interchange can be expected from future studies that are dedicated either to speciose families with large transcontinental distributions (Ebersbach et al., 2017) or to comparisons of independent radiations across clades of a speciose taxon such as Passeroidea in this study.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS # This study received substantial support from the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; project PA1818/3-1).

He was a paediatrics resident at Children\u0026rsquo;s Memorial Hospital, before taking a postdoctoral research position with Michael Bishop and Harold Varmus at the University of California at San Francisco. He subsequently moved to Stanford where he played an instrumental part in the development of microarray technology and its applications and where he is now a Professor of Biochemistry and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.\nfigure1\nPatrick O Brown\nPat has a long association with BioMed Central, dating from its origins at the beginning of the open access movement, and is on the Editorial Board of BMC Biology; so we asked him to give his own perspective on open access and how it began.\nDo you remember how and when the idea of open access first occurred to you? # It occurred to me in a kind of a roundabout way. I had been working on studies that involved looking at the expression of thousands or tens of thousands of genes under hundreds of different physiological conditions and in different developmental states, mostly in yeast, some in humans, so we had in our hands data sets that consisted of millions of quantitative measurements of gene expression that you can think of as a map that relates physiology and development and disease to patterns of expression of thousands or tens of thousands of genes.\nThis was in the very early years of microarrays? # Yes. Some of that data is interpretable without any external information, but its value is hugely enhanced if we can use it as a way of linking on the one hand things that we already know about physiological systems or developmental systems or diseases or particular tissue cell types, and on the other hand whatever we already know about the genes or their products: the links that are provided by those millions of data points in the gene expression arrays add a huge amount of value to existing information.\nSo every time we did an experiment my colleagues and I found ourselves digging up hundreds of papers to educate ourselves about things that we were seeing in the data. By that time a substantial fraction of the journals that were most relevant to what we were doing were being published online and since we were at Stanford we had access to at least most of them, but we knew we were not getting full value out of our data, first because we still didn\u0026rsquo;t have ready access to all the available knowledge that was published somewhere and would enable us to make better sense of it. Equally importantly, the manual search for published information that could add value to our data was unscalable. So we wanted to put the entire corpus of relevant articles in a database that would let us automate the process, but we were thwarted by publishers who strictly forbade downloading and automated analysis.\nThat led me to ask why should publishers be able to control what I can do with information that was published by my scientific colleagues whose motivation was exactly to have their discoveries contribute to future discoveries? And it became obvious that there were things about the way the scientific literature was organized that were anachronistic in 1997 when we had already existing tools that we could use to so to speak hyperlink things so that you could reorganize information in systematic ways, but they weren\u0026rsquo;t really being exploited by the conventional scientific literature.\nThen at about that time my lab had published a paper that involved a lot of supplementary information that we posted online the main server at Stanford, which was used by maybe a hundred scientists at Stanford, and more than half of all the bandwith of the server was taken up by people downloading our data. And so I thought OK well actually we should just stop publishing in journals altogether, and when we have something to report we\u0026rsquo;ll just post it up on this server and spread the word and bypass the whole annoying experience of publishing in journals, and just let the world decide if what we have is interesting. Well that was kind of a primitive idea but\u0026hellip;\nThis is something that physicists were already doing\u0026hellip; # I was just about to say that. At the time I wasn\u0026rsquo;t aware of what was then called the XXX.LANL preprint server [now http://arXiv.org] that Paul Ginsparg had created, but it was very close to that kind of thing that I had in mind. Paul had started a little server as an informal mechanism for exchanging preprints in his small community that just grew organically because it was such a useful thing.\nSo your idea was that there was no reason why this couldn\u0026rsquo;t be extended to biological sciences? # Yes. The way the existing journal system operated was completely unsuited to very data intensive research where the real need is to be able to use large systematic datasets as a way of providing links between disparate bits of information.\nAnd it was about that time that you started talking to people, including Vitek Tracz, who founded BioMed Central, about how to change the publishing world # Yes. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember the exact timing, but I do remember talking relatively early on in the process with Vitek and also with David [Lipman], and a few months later when I was organizing a genomics meeting with Gerry Rubin at Banbury [the Banbury Center at Cold Spring Harbor] I set up a session to which I invited David and Paul Ginsparg - because they hadn\u0026rsquo;t met - with the intention to brainstorm about how we could transform scientific publishing.\nThen around the same time Harold Varmus, who was then Director of the NIH - he was a friend of mine because he\u0026rsquo;d been my postdoc advisor some years before, and a fellow non-conformist personality was coming out to San Francisco, so I met him at a coffee shop, and went through the idea of setting up a NIH hosted server where scientists could post their work when they felt it was ready to share with the world, and where it would be organized in a systematic way. David Lipman and I had already started having conversations about things that still actually haven\u0026rsquo;t come to pass, discussing how one could make the system work. I still think they\u0026rsquo;re good ideas, but\u0026hellip; anyway, the upshot of it was that Harold was quite receptive and organized a follow-on meeting at NIH, and there was a lot of enthusiastic support, and from people of all stripes: it wasn\u0026rsquo;t just a bunch of genome geeks and bioinformatic types.\nAnd then over the next month or so Harold and I were bouncing back and forth by e-mail some documents about how this system might operate and what it could try to accomplish, and then Harold sent around to some publishers and societies, and also posted on the Director\u0026rsquo;s website a proposal for something that was dubbed e-Biomed. It\u0026rsquo;s still up there, at http://www.nih.gov/about/director/pubmedcentral/ebiomedarch.htm.\nIt is still up there, and what it makes clear is that once the idea of open access started to be developed, it was very much in the model of subscription-based print publishing, with peer review and so forth, which was not what you originally had in mind # Absolutely not. What we had in mind originally was much more radical in every way. And I should say those of us who have been involved in this for some time have absolutely not given up on this, it\u0026rsquo;s just been more slow and incremental than we had wished.\nBut what about open access itself - doesn\u0026rsquo;t it seem that open access has gained ground so fast that that battle is now all but won? # Well let\u0026rsquo;s put it this way: I think the tipping point was reached quite a while ago, and so in that sense it\u0026rsquo;s won: I think that there\u0026rsquo;s absolutely no going back: there\u0026rsquo;s a relentless ratchet effect so that step after step after step the subscription business model is becoming less and less sustainable, and the notion of open access publishing as the only right way to do things is becoming pretty well established I would say in the scientific community, and I think most of the existing publishers recognize that.\nSo we\u0026rsquo;re left with the issue of how to escape from the current peer review model - do you see that as the next frontier? # The thing that is most sick right now, besides the continued existence of restricted access, is the delay between an important discovery or idea or publishable body of information and its actual publication. For example, when a scientist makes an observation that\u0026rsquo;s the genesis of a new way to treat an important disease and submits it to a journal, nobody sees that paper until nine months later. Nine months later someone sees it, takes the next step, submits their own paper and it finally comes out another nine months later. Do a few cycles of that and something that, let\u0026rsquo;s say, can save millions of lives actually becomes available two years later than it had to, entirely because of a delay between a discovery being made and its being shared with the world. And that\u0026rsquo;s the situation we\u0026rsquo;re in now. That delay is the opportunity cost we pay for requiring peer-review before publication. I\u0026rsquo;m all for peer review, but I\u0026rsquo;m not for way it\u0026rsquo;s done now. You could have the peer review process - or a better peer review process - AFTER a paper has been published.\nBut let me just take a step back and say one thing: when we first started thinking about open access there were a lot ideas about how to fix scientific publishing, but we all realized quickly that by far the most important was open access. That was the sine qua non for everything else we wanted - to have the scientific literature be available unrestricted, to anyone to use in any way they wanted. Once you have that, then you not only make the benefits of the published research available to the whole world, but you have the potential for all kinds of experimentation, for building new tools, news ways of structuring the information, and so on.\nDo you think that has yet been fully exploited? # It\u0026rsquo;s not fully exploited, though I think it\u0026rsquo;s almost at the point where it will be, because for people to invest in building new systems for organizing and navigating the information you have to have a critical mass of raw material. You can\u0026rsquo;t have a patchwork. And I think the open access literature at this point is approaching a critical mass where that body of information is enough to allow us to ignore all the non-open access literature. We\u0026rsquo;ll reach a point where there\u0026rsquo;s a positive feedback loop: with enough information, people will develop tools to make open-access information more valuable, and then it will become increasingly more valuable than the restricted-access information because it\u0026rsquo;s not only accessible but it\u0026rsquo;s had value added to it in ways that can\u0026rsquo;t be applied to the restricted-access material, so that non-open access becomes progressively marginalized, and nobody wants to be in that space.\nNote # This article is part of the BMC Biology tenth anniversary series.

And it was about that time that you started talking to people, including Vitek Tracz, who founded BioMed Central, about how to change the publishing world It is still up there, and what it makes clear is that once the idea of open access started to be developed, it was very much in the model of subscription-based print publishing, with peer review and so forth, which was not what you originally had in mind But what about open access itself - doesn\u0026rsquo;t it seem that open access has gained ground so fast that that battle is now all but won?

The prevalence of manipulated photos in our everyday lives invites an important, yet largely unanswered, question: Can people detect photo forgeries? Previous research using simple computer-generated stimuli suggests people are poor at detecting geometrical inconsistencies within a scene. We do not know, however, whether such limitations also apply to real-world scenes that contain common properties that the human visual system is attuned to processing. In two experiments we asked people to detect and locate manipulations within images of real-world scenes. Subjects demonstrated a limited ability to detect original and manipulated images. Furthermore, across both experiments, even when subjects correctly detected manipulated images, they were often unable to locate the manipulation. People’s ability to detect manipulated images was positively correlated with the extent of disruption to the underlying structure of the pixels in the photo. We also explored whether manipulation type and individual differences were associated with people’s ability to identify manipulations. Taken together, our findings show, for the first time, that people have poor ability to identify whether a real-world image is original or has been manipulated. The results have implications for professionals working with digital images in legal, media, and other domains.\nSignificance # In the digital age, the availability of powerful, low-cost editing software means that the creation of visually compelling photographic fakes is growing at an incredible speed—we live in a world where nearly anyone can create and share a fake image. The rise of photo manipulation has consequences across almost all domains, from law enforcement and national security through to scientific publishing, politics, media, and advertising. Currently, however, scientists know very little about people’s ability to distinguish between original and fake images—the question of whether people can identify when images have been manipulated and what has been manipulated in the images of real-world scenes remains unanswered. The importance of this question becomes evident when considering that, more often than not, in today’s society we still rely on people to make judgments about image authenticity. This reliance applies to almost all digital images, from those that are used as evidence in the courtroom to those that we see every day in newspapers and magazines. Therefore, it is critical to better understand people’s ability to accurately identify fake from original images. This understanding will help to inform the development of effective guidelines and practices to address two key issues: how to better protect people from being fooled by fake images, and how to restore faith in original images.\nBackground # In 2015, one of the world’s most prestigious photojournalism events—The World Press Photo Contest—was shrouded in controversy following the disqualification of 22 entrants, including an overall prize winner, for manipulating their photo entries. News of the disqualifications led to a heated public debate about the role of photo manipulation in photojournalism. World Press Photo responded by issuing a new code of ethics for the forthcoming contest that stipulated entrants “must ensure their pictures provide an accurate and fair representation of the scene they witnessed so the audience is not misled” (World Press Photo). They also introduced new safeguards for detecting manipulated images, including a computerized photo-verification test for entries reaching the penultimate round of the competition. The need for such a verification process highlights the difficulties competition organizers face in trying to authenticate images. If photography experts can’t spot manipulated images, what hope is there for amateur photographers or other consumers of photographic images? This is the question we aimed to answer. That is, to what extent can lay people distinguish authentic photos from fakes?\nDigital image and manipulation technology has surged in the previous decades. People are taking more photos than ever before. Estimates suggested that one trillion photos would be taken in 2015 alone (Worthington, 2014), and that, on average, more than 350 million photos per day are uploaded to Facebook—that is over 14 million photos per hour or 4000 photos per second (Smith, 2013). Coinciding with this increased popularity of photos is the increasing frequency with which they are being manipulated. Although it is difficult to estimate the prevalence of photo manipulation, a recent global survey of photojournalists found that 76% regard photo manipulation as a serious problem, 51% claim to always or often enhance in-camera or RAW (i.e., unprocessed) files, and 25% admit that they, at least sometimes, alter the content of photos (Hadland, Campbell, \u0026amp; Lambert, 2015). Together these findings suggest that we are regularly exposed to a mix of real and fake images.\nThe prevalence and popularity of manipulated images raises two important questions. First, to what extent do manipulated images alter our thinking about the past? We know that images can have a powerful influence on our memories, beliefs, and behavior (e.g., Newman, Garry, Bernstein, Kantner, \u0026amp; Lindsay, 2012; Wade, Garry, Read, \u0026amp; Lindsay, 2002; Wade, Green, \u0026amp; Nash, 2010). Merely viewing a doctored photo and attempting to recall the event it depicts can lead people to remember wholly false experiences, such as taking a childhood hot-air balloon ride or meeting the Warner Brothers character Bugs Bunny at Disneyland (Braun, Ellis, \u0026amp; Loftus, 2002; Sacchi, Agnoli, \u0026amp; Loftus, 2007; Strange, Sutherland, \u0026amp; Garry, 2006). Thus, if people cannot differentiate between real and fake details in photos, manipulations could frequently alter what we believe and remember.\nSecond, to what extent should photos be admissible as evidence in court? Laws governing the use of photographic evidence in legal cases, such as the Federal Rules of Evidence (1975), have not kept up with digital change (Parry, 2009). Photos were once difficult to manipulate; the process was complex, laborious, and required expertise. Yet in the digital age, even amateurs can use sophisticated image-editing software to create detailed and compelling fake images. The Federal Rules of Evidence state that the content of a photo can be proven if a witness confirms it is fair and accurate. Put another way, the person who took the photo, any person who subsequently handles it, or any person present when the photo was taken, is not required to testify about the authenticity of the photo. If people cannot distinguish between original and fake photos, then litigants might use manipulated images to intentionally deceive the court, or even testify about images, unaware they have been changed.\nUnfortunately, there is no simple solution to prevent people from being fooled by manipulated photos in everyday life or in the criminal arena (Parry, 2009). But the newly emerging field of image forensics is making it possible to better protect against photo fraud (e.g., Farid, 2006). Image forensics uses digital technology to determine image authenticity, and is based on the premise that digital manipulation alters the values of the pixels that make up an image. Put simply, the act of manipulating a photo leaves behind a trace, even if only subtle and not visible to the naked eye (Farid, 2009). Given that different types of manipulations—for instance, cloning, retouching, splicing—affect the underlying pixels in unique and systematic ways, image forensic experts can develop computer methods to reveal image forgeries. Such technological developments are being implemented in several domains, including law, photojournalism, and scientific publishing (Oosterhoff, 2015). The vast majority of image authenticity judgments, however, are still made by eye, and to our knowledge only one published study has explored the extent to which people can detect inconsistencies in images.\nFarid and Bravo (2010) investigated how well people can make use of three cues— shadows, reflections, and perspective distortion—that are often indicative of photo tampering. The researchers created a series of computer-generated scenes consisting of basic geometrical shapes. Some scenes, for instance, were consistent with a single light source whereas others were inconsistent with a single light source. When the inconsistencies were obvious, that is, when shadows ran in opposite directions, observers were able to identify tampering with nearly 100% accuracy. Yet when the inconsistencies were subtle, for instance, where the shadows were a combination of results from two different light positions on the same side of the room, observers performed only slightly better than chance. These preliminary findings, based on computer-generated scenes of geometric objects, suggest that the human visual system is poor at identifying inconsistencies in such images.\nIn the current study we examined whether people are similarly poor at detecting inconsistencies within images of real-world scenes. On the one hand, we might expect people to perform even worse if trying to detect manipulations in real-world photos. Research shows that real-world photos typically contain many multi-element objects that can obscure distortions (Bex, 2010; Hulleman \u0026amp; Olivers, 2015). For example, people with the visual impairment metamorphopsia often do not notice any problems with their vision in their everyday experiences, yet the impairment is quite apparent when they view simple stimuli, such as a grid of evenly spaced horizontal and vertical lines (Amsler, 1953; Bouwens \u0026amp; Meurs, 2003). We also know that people find it more difficult to detect certain types of distortions, such as changes to image contrast, in complex real-world scenes than in more simplistic stimuli (Bex, 2010; Bex, Solomon, \u0026amp; Dakin, 2009). In sum, if people find it particularly difficult to detect manipulations in complex real-world scenes, then we might expect our subjects to perform worse than Farid and Bravo’s (2010) subjects.\nOn the other hand, there is good reason to predict that people might do well at detecting manipulations in real-world scenes. Visual cognition research suggests that people might detect image manipulations using their knowledge of the typical appearance of real-world scenes. Real-world scenes share common properties, such as the way the luminance values of the pixels are organized and structured (Barlow, 1961; Gardner-Medwin \u0026amp; Barlow, 2001; Olshausen \u0026amp; Field, 2000). Over time, the human visual system has become attuned to such statistical regularities and has expectations about how scenes should look. When an image is manipulated, the structure of the image properties change, which can create a mismatch between what people see and what they expect to see (Craik, 1943; Friston, 2005; Rao \u0026amp; Ballard, 1999; Tolman, 1948). Thus, based on this real-world scene statistics account, we might predict that people should be able to use this “mismatch” as a cue to detecting a manipulation. If so, our subjects should perform better than chance at detecting manipulations in real-world scenes.\nAlthough there is a lack of research directly investigating the applied question of people’s ability to detect photo forgeries, people’s ability to detect change in a scene is well-studied in visual cognition. Notably, change blindness is the striking finding that, in some situations, people are surprisingly slow, or entirely unable, to detect changes made to, or find differences between, two scenes (e.g., Pashler, 1988; Simons, 1996; Simons \u0026amp; Levin, 1997). In some of the early studies, researchers demonstrated observers’ inability to detect changes made to a scene during an eye movement (saccade) using very simple stimuli (e.g., Wallach \u0026amp; Lewis, 1966), and later, in complex real-world scenes (e.g., Grimes, 1996). Researchers have also shown that change blindness occurs even when the eyes are fixated on the scene: The flicker paradigm, for instance, simulates the effects of a saccade or eye blink by inserting a blank screen between the continuous and sequential presentation of an original and changed image (Rensink, O’Regan, \u0026amp; Clark, 1997). It often requires a large number of alternations between the two images before the change can be identified. Furthermore, change blindness persists when the original and changed images are shown side by side (Scott-Brown, Baker, \u0026amp; Orbach, 2000), when change is masked by a camera cut in motion pictures (Levin \u0026amp; Simons, 1997), and even when change occurs in real-world situations (Simons \u0026amp; Levin, 1998).\nSuch striking failures of perception suggest that people do not automatically form a complete and detailed visual representation of a scene in memory. Therefore, to detect change, it might be necessary to draw effortful, focused attention to the changed aspect (Simons \u0026amp; Levin, 1998). So which aspects of a scene are most likely to gain focused attention? One suggestion is that attention is guided by salience; the more salient aspects of a scene attract attention and are represented more precisely than less salient aspects. In support of this idea, research has shown that changes to more important objects are more readily detected than changes made to less important objects (Rensink et al., 1997). Other findings, however, indicate that observers sometimes miss even large changes to central aspects of a scene (Simons \u0026amp; Levin, 1998). Therefore, the question of what determines scene saliency continues to be explored. Specifically, researchers disagree about whether the low-level visual salience of objects in a scene, such as brightness (e.g., Lansdale, Underwood, \u0026amp; Davies, 2010; Pringle, Irwin, Kramer, \u0026amp; Atchley, 2001; Spotorno \u0026amp; Faure, 2011) or the high-level semantic meaning of the scene (Stirk \u0026amp; Underwood, 2007) has the most influence on attentional allocation.\nWhat other factors affect people’s susceptibility to change blindness? One robust finding in the signal detection literature is that the ability to make accurate perceptual decisions is related to the strength of the signal and the amount of noise (Green \u0026amp; Swets, 1966). Signal detection theory has been applied to change detection. In one study, observers judged whether two sequentially presented arrays of colored dots remained identical or if there was a change (Wilken \u0026amp; Ma, 2004). Crucially, the researchers manipulated the strength of the signal in the change trials by varying the number of colored dots in the display that changed, while noise (total set size) remained constant. Performance improved as a function of the number of dots in the display that changed color—put simply, greater signal resulted in greater change detection.\nGiven the lack of research investigating people’s ability to detect photo forgeries, change blindness offers a highly relevant area of research. A key difference between the change blindness research and our current experiments, however, is that our change detection task does not involve a comparison of two images; therefore, representing the scene in memory is not a factor in our research. That is, subjects do not compare the original and manipulated versions of an image. Instead, they make their judgment based on viewing only a single image. This image is either the original, unaltered image or an image that has been manipulated in some way.\nIn the current study, we explored people’s ability to identify common types of image manipulations that are frequently applied to real-world photos. We distinguished between physically implausible versus plausible manipulations. For example, a physically implausible image might depict an outdoor scene lit only by the sun with a person’s shadow running one way and a car’s shadow running the other way. Such shadows imply the impossible: two suns. Alternatively, when an unfamiliar face is retouched in an image it is quite plausible; eliminating spots and wrinkles or whitening teeth do not contradict physical constraints in the world that govern how faces ought to look. In our study, geometrical and shadow manipulations made up our implausible manipulation category, while airbrushing and addition or subtraction manipulations made up our plausible manipulation category. Our fifth manipulation type, super-additive, presented all four manipulation types in a single image and thus included both categories of manipulation.\nWe had a number of predictions about people’s ability to detect and locate manipulations in real-world photos. We expected the type of manipulation—implausible versus plausible—to affect people’s ability to detect and locate manipulations. In particular, people should correctly identify more of the physically implausible manipulations than the physically plausible manipulations given the availability of evidence within the photo. We also expected people to be better at correctly detecting and locating manipulations that caused more change to the pixels in the photo than manipulations that caused less change.\nExperiment 1 # Methods # Subjects and design # A total of 707 (M = 25.8 years, SD = 8.8, range = 14–82; 460 male, 226 female, 21 declined to respond) subjects completed the task online. A further 17 subjects were excluded from the analyses because they had missing response time data for at least one response on the detection or location task. There were no geographical restrictions and subjects did not receive payment for taking part, but they did receive feedback on their performance at the end of the task. Subject recruitment stopped when we reached at least 100 responses per photo. We used a within-subjects design in which each person viewed a series of ten photos, half of which had one of five manipulation types applied, and half of which were original, non-manipulated photos. We measured people’s accuracy in determining whether a photo had been manipulated or not and their ability to locate manipulations.\nStimuli # We obtained ten colored images (JPEG format), 1600 × 1200 pixels, that depicted people in real-world scenes from Google Image search (permitted for non-commercial re-use with modification). The first author (SN) used GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) to apply five different, commonly used manipulation techniques: (a) airbrushing, (b) addition or subtraction, (c) geometrical inconsistency, (d) shadow inconsistency, and (e) super-additive (manipulations a to d included within a single image). For the airbrushing technique, we changed the person’s appearance by whitening their teeth, removing spots, wrinkles, or sweat, or brightening their eye color. For the addition or subtraction technique, we added or removed objects, or parts of objects. For example, we removed links between tower columns on a suspension bridge and inserted a boat into a river scene. For geometrical inconsistencies, we created physically implausible changes, such as distorting angles of buildings or sheering trees in different directions to others to indicate inconsistent wind direction. For shadow inconsistencies, we removed or changed the direction of a shadow to make it incompatible with the remaining shadows in the scene. For instance, flipping a person’s face around the vertical axis causes the shadow to appear on the wrong side compared with the rest of the body and scene. In the super-additive technique we presented all four previously described manipulation types in one photo. Figure 1 shows examples of the five manipulation types, and higher resolution versions of these images, as well as other stimuli examples, appear in Additional file 1.\nFig. 1 figure1 Samples of manipulated photos. a Original photo; b airbrushing—removal of sweat on the nose, cheeks, and chin, and removal of wrinkles around the eyes; c addition or subtraction—two links between the columns of the tower of the suspension bridge removed; d geometrical inconsistency—top of the bridge is sheered at an angle inconsistent with the rest of the bridge; e shadow inconsistency—face is flipped around the vertical axis so that the light is on the wrong side of the face compared with lighting in the rest of the scene; f super-additive—combination of all previously described manipulations.

The non-manipulated version of each of these ten photos was used to create our original photo set. To generate the manipulated photos, we applied each of the five manipulation types to six of the ten photos, creating six versions of each manipulation for a total of 30 manipulated photos. This gave us an overall set of 40 photos. Subjects saw each of the five manipulation types and five original images but always on a different photo.\nImage-based saliency cues can determine where subjects direct their attention; thus, we checked whether our manipulations had changed the salience of the manipulated area within the image. To examine this, we ran the images through two independent saliency models: the classic Itti-Koch model (Itti \u0026amp; Koch, 2000; Itti, Koch, \u0026amp; Niebur, 1998) and the Graph-Based Visual Saliency (GBVS) model (Harel, Koch, \u0026amp; Perona, 2006). To summarize, we found that our manipulations did not inadvertently change the salience of the manipulated regions. See Additional file 2 for details of these analyses.\nProcedure # Subjects answered questions about their demographics, attitudes towards image manipulation, and experiences of taking and manipulating photos. Subjects were then shown a practice photo and instructed to adjust their browser zoom level so that the full image was visible. Next, subjects were presented with ten photos in a random order and they had an unlimited amount of time to view and respond to each photo. We first measured subjects’ ability to detect whether each photo had been manipulated by asking “Do you think this photograph has been digitally altered?” Subjects were given three response options: (a) “Yes, and I can see exactly where the digital alteration has been made”; (b) “Yes, but I cannot see specifically what has been digitally altered”; or (c) “No.” For the manipulated photos, we considered either of the “yes” responses as correct; for original photos we considered “no” as correct. Following a “yes” response, we immediately measured subjects’ ability to locate the manipulation by presenting the same photo again with a 3 × 3 grid overlaid1 (see Fig. 2 for an example). Subjects were asked to: “Please select the box that you believe contains the digitally altered area of the photograph (if you believe that more than one region contains digital alteration, please select the one you feel contains the majority of the change).” On average, manipulations spanned two regions in the grid. For the analyses we considered a response to be correct if the subject clicked on a region that contained any of the manipulated area or a nearby area that could be used as evidence that a manipulation had taken place—a relatively liberal criterion. Subjects received feedback on their performance at the end of the study.\nFig. 2 figure2 Example of a photo with the location grid overlaid.

In the detection task, the mean response time per photo was 43.8 s (SD = 73.3 s) and the median response time 30.4 s (interquartile range 21.4, 47.7 s). In the location task, the mean response time was 10.5 s (SD = 5.7 s) and the median response time 9.1 s (interquartile range 6.5, 13.1 s). Following Cumming’s (2012) recommendations, we present our findings in line with the estimation approach by calculating a precise estimate of the actual size of the effects.\nOverall accuracy on the detection task and the location task # We now turn to our primary research question: To what extent can people detect and locate manipulations of real-world photos? For the detection task, we collapsed across the two “yes” response options such that if subjects responded either “Yes, and I can see exactly where the digital alteration has been made” or “Yes, but I cannot see specifically what has been digitally altered”, then we considered this to be a “yes” response. Thus, chance performance was 50%. Overall performance on the detection task was better than chance; a mean 66% of the photos were correctly classified as original or manipulated, 95% confidence interval (CI)2 [65%, 67%]. Subjects’ ability to distinguish between original (72% correct) and manipulated (60% correct) photos of real-world scenes was reliably greater than zero, discrimination (d\u0026rsquo;) = 0.80, 95% CI [0.74, 0.85]. Moreover, subjects showed a bias towards saying that photos were real; response bias (c) = 0.16, 95% CI [0.12, 0.19]. Although subjects’ ability to detect manipulated images was above chance, it was still far from perfect. Furthermore, even when subjects correctly indicated that a photo had been manipulated, they could not necessarily locate the manipulation. Collapsing over all manipulation types, a mean 45% of the manipulations were accurately located, 95% CI [43%, 46%]. To determine chance performance in the location task, we need to take into account that subjects were asked to select one of nine regions of the image. Therefore, subjects had less chance of being correct by guessing in the location task than the detection task. On average, the manipulations were contained within two of the nine regions. But because the chance of being correct by guessing varied for each image and each manipulation type, we ran a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the chance rate of selecting the correct region. Table 1 shows the results from one million simulated responses. Overall, chance performance was 24%; therefore, collectively, subjects performed better than chance on the location task. Overall, the results show that people have some (above chance) ability to detect and locate manipulations, although performance is far from perfect.\nTable 1 Mean number of regions (out of a possible nine) containing manipulation and results of Monte Carlo simulation to determine chance performance in location task by manipulation type and overall\nManipulation type Number of regions Percentage correct by chance M M 95% CI Airbrushing 1.83 20 [20, 21] Add/sub 1.33 17 [17, 17] Geometry 1.5 19 [18, 19] Shadow 1.67 15 [15, 15] Super-additive 4.33 48 [48, 48] Overall 2.13 24 [24, 24] CI confidence interval. For each manipulation type, we show the mean number of regions that contained the manipulation across all six images. The manipulation type “Overall” is the mean number of manipulated regions across all six images and all five manipulation types. To determine chance performance in the location task, we ran a Monte Carlo simulation of one million responses based on the number of regions manipulated for each image and manipulation type\nFull size table\nAbility to detect and locate by manipulation type # We predicted that people’s ability to detect and locate manipulations might vary according to the manipulation type. Figure 3 shows subjects’ accuracy on both the detection and the location task by manipulation type. In line with our prediction, subjects were better at detecting manipulations that included physically implausible changes (geometrical inconsistencies, shadow inconsistencies, and super-additive manipulations) than images that included physically plausible changes (airbrushing alterations and addition or subtraction of objects).\nFig. 3 figure3 Mean proportion of correct “detect” and “locate” decisions by type of photo manipulation. The dotted line represents chance performance for detection. The grey dotted lines on the locate bars represent chance performance by manipulation type in the location task. Error bars represent 95% CIs\nFull size image It was not the case, however, that subjects were necessarily better at locating the manipulation within the photo when the change was physically implausible. Figure 4 shows the proportion of manipulated photo trials in which subjects correctly detected a manipulation and also went on to correctly locate that manipulation, by manipulation type. Across both physically implausible and physically plausible manipulation types, subjects often correctly indicated that photos were manipulated but failed to then accurately locate the manipulation. Furthermore, although the physically implausible geometrical inconsistencies were more often correctly located, the shadow inconsistencies were only located equally as often as the physically plausible manipulation types—airbrushing and addition or subtraction. These findings suggest that people may find it easier to detect physically implausible, rather than plausible, manipulations, but this is not the case when it comes to locating the manipulation.\nFig. 4 figure4 Mean proportion of correct “locate” decisions when subjects correctly detected that the photo was manipulated (i.e., correctly said “Yes” on the detection task). The grey dotted lines on the bars represent chance performance for each manipulation type. Error bars represent 95% CIs\nFull size image\nImage metrics and accuracy # To understand more about people’s ability to identify image manipulations, we examined how the amount of change in a photo affects people’s accuracy in the detection and location tasks. When an image is digitally altered, the structure of the underlying elements—the pixels—are changed. This change can be quantified in numerous ways but we chose to use Delta-E76 because it is a measure based on both color and luminance (Robertson, 1977). To calculate Delta-E, we first converted the images in Matlab® to Lab* color space because it has a dimension for lightness as well as color. Next we calculated the difference between corresponding pixels in the original and manipulated versions of each photo. Finally, these differences were averaged to give a single Delta-E score for each manipulated photo. A higher Delta-E value indicates a greater amount of difference between the original and the manipulated photo.3 We calculated Delta-E for each of the 30 manipulated photos.\nFigure 5 shows the log Delta-E values on the x-axis, where larger values indicate more change in the color and luminance values of pixels in the manipulated photos compared with their original counterpart. The proportions of correct detection (Fig. 5a) and location (Fig. 5b) responses for each of the manipulated photos are presented on the y-axis. We found a positive relationship between the Delta-E measure and the proportion of photos that subjects correctly detected as manipulated, albeit not reaching significance: r(28) = 0.34, p = 0.07.4 Furthermore, the Delta-E measure was positively correlated with the proportion of manipulations that were correctly located, r(28) = 0.41, p = 0.03. As predicted, these data suggest that people might be sensitive to the low level properties of real-world scenes when making judgments about the authenticity of photos. This finding is especially remarkable given that our subjects never saw the same scene more than once and so never saw the original version of a manipulated image. This finding fits with the proposition that disrupting the underlying pixel structure might exacerbate the difference between the manipulated photos and people’s expectations of how a scene should look. Presumably, these disruptions make it easier for people to accurately classify manipulated photos as being manipulated. We can also interpret these findings based on a signal detection account—adding greater signal (in our experiment, more change to an image, as measured by Delta-E) results in greater detection of that signal (Green \u0026amp; Swets, 1966; Wilken \u0026amp; Ma, 2004).\nFig. 5 figure5 Mean proportion of correctly detected (a) and located (b) image manipulations by extent of pixel distortion as measured by Delta-E. The graphs show individual data points for each of the 30 manipulated images\nFull size image Next, we tested whether there was a relationship between the mean amount of change and the mean proportion of correct detection (Fig. 6a) and location (Fig. 6b) responses by the category of manipulation type. As Fig. 6 shows, there was a numerical, but non-significant, trend for a positive relationship between amount of change and the proportion of photos that subjects correctly detected as manipulated: r(3) = 0.68, p = 0.21. There was also a numerical trend for a positive relationship between amount of change and the proportion of manipulations that were correctly located: r(3) = 0.69, p = 0.19.\nFig. 6 figure6 Mean proportion of correctly detected (a) and located (b) image manipulations by extent of pixel distortion as measured by Delta-E. The graphs show the mean values for each of the five categories of manipulation type\nFull size image\nIndividual factors in detecting and locating manipulations # To determine whether individual factors play a role in detecting and locating manipulations, we gathered subjects’ demographic data, attitudes towards image manipulation, and experiences of taking and manipulating photos. We also recorded subjects’ response times on the detection and location tasks.\nTo determine how each factor influenced subjects’ performance on the manipulated image trials, we conducted two generalized estimating equation (GEE) analyses—one for accuracy on the detection task and one for accuracy on the location task. Specifically, we conducted a repeated measures logistic regression with GEE because our dependent variables were binary with both random and fixed effects (Liang \u0026amp; Zeger, 1986). For the detection task, we ran two additional repeated measures linear regression GEE models to explore the effect of the predictor variables on signal detection estimates d\u0026rsquo; and c. The results of the GEE analyses are shown in Table 2. In the detection task, faster responses were more likely to be associated with accurate responses than slower responses. There was also a small effect of people’s general belief about the prevalence of manipulated photos in their everyday lives on accuracy in the detection task. Those who believe a greater percentage of photos are digitally manipulated were more likely to correctly identify manipulated photos than those who believe a lower percentage of photos are digitally manipulated. Further, the results of the signal detection analysis suggest that this results from a difference in ability to discriminate between original and manipulated photos, rather than a shift in response bias—those who believe a greater percentage of photos are digitally manipulated accurately identified more of the manipulated photos without an increased false alarm rate. General beliefs about the prevalence of photo manipulation did not have an effect on people’s ability to locate the manipulation. This pattern of results is somewhat surprising. It seems intuitive to think that a general belief that manipulated photos are prevalent simply makes people more likely to report that a photo is manipulated because they are generally skeptical about the veracity of photos rather than because they are better at spotting fakes. Although interesting, the small effect size and counterintuitive nature of the finding indicate that it is important to replicate the result prior to drawing any strong conclusions. The only variable that had an effect on accuracy in the location task was gender; males were slightly more likely than females to correctly locate the manipulation within the photo.\nFull size table\nTable 2 Results of the GEE binary logistic and linear regression models to determine variables that predict accuracy on the detect and locate tasks\nPredictor Detect Locate B OR 95% CI p B OR 95% CI p Response time Accuracy 0.11 1.11 [1.08, 1.15] \u0026lt;0.001 - - - d' −0.01 0.99 [0.98, 1.01] 0.31 - - - c 0.01 1.01 [1.00, 1.02] 0.10 - - - General beliefs about percentage of images manipulated = High (71–100%) Accuracy 0.20 1.22 [1.06, 1.41] 0.01 0.11 1.11 [0.98, 1.26] 0.10 d' 0.16 1.17 [1.05, 1.30] 0.01 - - - c −0.05 0.96 [0.90, 1.02] 0.16 - - - Gender = Female Accuracy 0.05 1.05 [0.90, 1.23] 0.50 −0.16 0.86 [0.75, 0.98] 0.03 d' −0.06 0.95 [0.84, 1.06] 0.35 - - - c −0.05 0.95 [0.89, 1.02] 0.15 - - - Interest in photography = Interested Accuracy 0.06 1.07 [0.92, 1.24] 0.41 0.04 1.05 [0.92, 1.19] 0.51 d' −0.02 0.98 [0.88, 1.10] 0.73 - - - c −0.05 0.96 [0.89, 1.03] 0.20 - - - Frequency of taking photos = Daily/weekly Accuracy −0.15 0.86 [0.73, 1.01] 0.07 −0.07 0.94 [0.81, 1.08] 0.35 d' −0.08 0.92 [0.81, 1.04] 0.18 - - - c 0.01 1.01 [0.94, 1.09] 0.71 - - - B and odds ratios (OR) estimate the degree of change in (a) accuracy on the task (based on the manipulated image trials), (b) d\u0026rsquo;, or (c) c associated with one unit change in the independent variable. An odds ratio of 1 indicates no effect of the independent variable on accuracy; values of 1.5, 2.5, and 4.0 are generally considered to reflect small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively (Rosenthal, 1996). The category order for factors was set to descending to make the reference level 0. The reference groups are: General beliefs about percentage of images manipulated = Low (0–70%), Gender = Male, Interest in photography = Not Interested, Frequency of taking photos = Monthly/yearly/never. For response time (RT) we divided the data into eight equal groups (level 1 represents the slowest RTs (≥43.4 s) and level 8 the fastest RTs (≤8.4 s)). The 21 subjects who chose not to disclose their gender were excluded from these analyses leaving a total sample of n = 686. Given that subjects only responded on the location task if they said “yes”, the photo had been manipulated, we did not have location response time data for all of the trials and therefore were unable to consider response time on the location task. Because we did not have a fixed number of choices per condition in the location task, we were unable to calculate the degree of change in d\u0026rsquo; or c associated with the predictor variables\nTogether these findings show that individual factors have relatively little impact on the ability to detect and locate manipulations. Although shorter response times were associated with more correct detections of manipulated photos, we did not manipulate response time so we cannot know whether response time affects people’s ability to discriminate between original and manipulated photos. In fact, our response time findings might be explained by a number of perceptual decision making models, for example, the drift diffusion model (Ratcliff, 1978). However, determining the precise mechanism that accounts for the association between shorter response times and greater accuracy is beyond the scope of the current paper.\nExperiment 1 indicates that people have some ability to distinguish between original and manipulated real-world photos. People’s ability to correctly identify manipulated photos was better than chance, although not by much. Our data also suggest that locating photo manipulations is a difficult task, even when people correctly indicate that a photo is manipulated. We should note, however, that our study could have underestimated people’s ability to locate manipulations in real-world photos. Recall that subjects were only asked to locate manipulations on photos that they thought were manipulated. It remains possible people might be able to locate manipulations even if they do not initially think that a photo has been manipulated. We were unable to check this possibility in Experiment 1, so we addressed this issue in Experiment 2 by asking subjects to complete the location task for all photos, regardless of their initial response in the detection task. If subjects did not think that the photo had been manipulated, we asked them to make a guess about which area of the image might have been changed.\nWe also created a new set of photographic stimuli for Experiment 2. Rather than sourcing photos online, the first author captured a unique set of photos on a Nikon D40 camera in RAW format, and prior to any digital editing, converted the files to PNGs. There are two crucial benefits to using original photos rather than downloading photos from the web. First, by using original photos we could be certain that our images had not been previously manipulated in any way. Second, when digital images are saved, the data are compressed to reduce the file size. JPEG compression is lossy in that some information is discarded to reduce file size. This information is not generally noticeable to the human eye (except at very high compression rates when compression artifacts can occur); however, the process of converting RAW files to PNGs (a lossless format) prevented any loss of data in either the original or manipulated images and, again, ensured that our photos were not manipulated in any way before we intentionally manipulated them.\nExperiment 2 # Methods # Subjects and design # A total of 659 (M = 25.5 years, SD = 8.2, range = 13–70; 362 male, 283 female, 14 declined to respond) subjects completed the study online. A further 32 subjects were excluded from the analyses because they had missing response time data for at least one response on the detection or location task. As in Experiment 1, subjects did not receive payment for taking part but were given feedback on their performance at the end of the study. We stopped collecting data once we reached 100 responses per photo. The design was similar to that of Experiment 1.\nStimuli # We took our own photos in RAW format at a resolution of 3008 × 2000 pixels and converted them to PNGs with a resolution of 1600 × 1064 pixels prior to any digital editing. We checked the photos to ensure there were no spatial distortions caused by the lens, such as barrel or pincushion distortion. The photo manipulation process was the same as in Experiment 1. We applied the five manipulation techniques to six different photos to create a total of 30 manipulated photos. We used the non-manipulated version of these six photos and another four non-manipulated photos to give a total of ten original photos. Thus, the total number of photos was 40. As in Experiment 1, we ran two independent saliency models to check whether our manipulations had influenced the salience of the region where the manipulation had been made. See Additional file 2 for details of the saliency analyses. Similar to Experiment 1, our manipulations made little difference to the salience of the regions of the image.\nProcedure # The procedure was similar to that used in Experiment 1, except for the following two changes. First, subjects were asked to locate the manipulation regardless of their response in the detection task. Second, subjects were asked to click on one of 12, rather than nine, regions on the photo to locate the manipulation. We increased the number of regions on the grid to ensure that the manipulations in the photos spanned two regions, on average, as per Experiment 1.\nResults and discussion # As in Experiment 1, subjects spent a reasonable amount of time examining the photos. In the detection task, the mean response time per photo was 57.8 s (SD = 271.5 s) and the median 24.3 s (interquartile range = 17.3 to 37.4 s). In the location task, the mean response time was 10.9 s (SD = 27.0 s) and the median 8.2 s (interquartile range = 6.1 to 11.2 s).\nOverall accuracy on the detection task and the location task # Overall accuracy in the detection task was slightly lower than that observed in Experiment 1, but still above chance: Subjects correctly classified 62% of the photos as being original or manipulated (cf. 66% in Experiment 1), 95% CI [60%, 63%]. Subjects had some ability to discriminate between original (58% correct) and manipulated (65% correct) photos, d\u0026rsquo; = 0.56, 95% CI [0.50, 0.62], replicating the results from Experiment 1. Again, this provides some support for the prediction that the match or mismatch between the information in the photo and people’s expectation of what real-world scenes look like might help people to identify original and manipulated real-world photos. In contrast to Experiment 1, however, subjects did not show a bias towards saying that photos were authentic: c = −0.07, 95% CI [−0.10, −0.04]. It is possible that asking all subjects to search for evidence of a manipulation—the location task—regardless of their answer in the detection task, prompted a more careful consideration of the scene. In line with this account, subjects in Experiment 2 spent a mean of 14 s longer per photo on the detection task than those in Experiment 1.\nRecall that the results from Experiment 1 suggested that subjects found the location task difficult, even when they correctly detected the photo as manipulated. Yet, we were unable to conclusively say that location was more difficult than detection because we did not have location data for the manipulated photo trials that subjects failed to detect. In Experiment 2 we gathered those data, but before we could directly compare subjects’ ability to detect manipulated photos with their ability to locate the manipulations within, we had to correct for guessing. For the detection task, chance performance was the same as Experiment 1, 50%. For the location task, however, there were two differences to Experiment 1. First, subjects were asked to select one of 12, rather than one of nine, image regions. Second, we used a new image set; thus, the number of regions manipulated for each image and manipulation type changed. Accordingly, we ran a separate Monte Carlo simulation to determine the chance rate of selecting the correct region. Table 3 shows that overall chance performance in the location task was 17%.\nTable 3 Mean number of regions (out of a possible 12) containing manipulation and results of Monte Carlo simulation to determine chance performance in location task by manipulation type and overall\nManipulation type Number of regions Percentage correct by chance M M 95% CI Airbrushing 1.50 12 [12, 13] Add/sub 1.33 11 [11, 11] Geometry 1.33 11 [11, 11] Shadow 1.33 11 [11, 11] Super-additive 4.67 39 [39, 39] Overall 2.03 17 [17, 17] CI confidence interval. For each manipulation type, we show the mean number of regions that contained the manipulation across all six images. The manipulation type “Overall” is the mean number of manipulated regions across all six images and all five manipulation types. To determine chance performance in the location task, we ran a Monte Carlo simulation of one million responses based on the number of regions manipulated for each image and manipulation type\nFull size table\nSubjects performed better than chance on the location task: a mean 56% of the manipulations were accurately located, 95% CI [55%, 58%]. Given that a mean 62% of the manipulated images were accurately detected and a mean 56% of the manipulations located, it seems that performance was very roughly similar on the two tasks. But this interpretation doesn’t take into account how subjects would perform by chance alone. A fairer approach is to compare subjects’ performance on the detection and location tasks with chance performance on those two tasks. For the detection task, subjects detected a mean 12% more manipulated images than would be expected by chance alone, 95% CI [10%, 13%]. Yet, somewhat surprisingly, subjects located a mean 39% more of the manipulations than would be expected by chance alone, 95% CI [38%, 41%]. This finding suggests that people are better at the more direct task of locating manipulations than the more generic one of detecting if a photo has been manipulated or not. Although this potential distinction between people’s ability to detect and locate manipulations is an interesting finding, the reason for it is not immediately apparent. One possibility is that our assumption that each of the 12 image regions has an equal chance of being picked is too simplistic—perhaps certain image regions never get picked (e.g., a relatively featureless area of the sky). If so, including these never picked regions in our chance calculation might make subjects’ performance on the location task seem artificially high. To check this possibility, we ran a second chance performance calculation.\nIn Experiment 2, even when subjects did not think that the image had been manipulated, they still attempted to guess the region that had been changed. Therefore, we can use these localization decisions in the original (non-manipulated) versions of the six critical photos to determine chance performance in the task. This analysis allows us to calculate chance based on the regions (of non-manipulated images) that people actually selected when guessing rather than assuming each of the 12 regions has an equal chance of being picked. Using this approach, Table 4 shows that overall chance performance in the location task was 23%. Therefore, even based on this chance localization level, subjects still located a mean 33% more of the locations than would be expected by chance alone, 95% CI [32%, 35%]. This finding supports the idea that subjects are better at the more direct task of locating manipulations than detecting whether a photo has been manipulated or not.\nTable 4 Chance performance in location task by manipulation type and overall based on mean number of subjects choosing the manipulated region in the original version of the image\nManipulation type Percentage correct by chance Image A B C D E F Overall Airbrushing 19 31 28 28 23 20 25 Add/sub 24 5 15 3 3 1 9 Geometry 11 12 17 2 26 12 13 Shadow 20 16 28 39 4 5 19 Super-additive 74 63 44 72 33 26 53 Overall image 30 25 27 29 18 13 23 For each of the six critical images and each of the five manipulation types, we show the probability that the manipulated region of the image was selected by chance in the original version of the image. The “Overall” column denotes the mean probability of selecting the manipulated regions for that manipulation type across all 6 images A-F. The “Overall image” is the mean probability of selecting the manipulated regions for that image across all manipulation types. Each image had a minimum of 101 responses Full size table Ability to detect and locate manipulations # On the manipulated photo trials, asking subjects to locate the manipulation regardless of whether they correctly detected it allowed us to segment accuracy in the following ways: (i) accurately detected and accurately located (hereafter, DL), (ii) accurately detected but not accurately located (DnL), (iii) inaccurately detected but accurately located (nDL), or (iv) inaccurately detected and inaccurately located (nDnL). Intuitively, it seems most practical to consider the more conservative accuracy—DL—as correct, especially in certain contexts, such as the legal domain, where it is crucial to know not only that an image has been manipulated, but precisely what about it is fake. That said, it might be possible to learn from the DnL and nDL cases to try to better understand how people process manipulated images.\nFigure 7 shows the proportion of DL, DnL, nDL, and nDnL responses for each of the manipulation types. The most common outcomes were for subjects to both accurately detect and accurately locate manipulations, or both inaccurately detect and inaccurately locate manipulations. It is interesting, however, that on almost a fifth (18%) of the manipulated photo trials, subjects accurately detected the photo as manipulated yet failed to locate the alteration. For 10% of the manipulated trials, subjects failed to detect but went on to successfully locate the manipulation. Subjects infrequently managed to detect and locate airbrushing manipulations; in fact it was more likely that subjects made DnL or nDL responses. Although this fits with our prediction that plausible manipulations would be more difficult to identify than implausible ones, the pattern of results for geometrical inconsistency, shadow inconsistency, and addition or subtraction do not support our prediction. Subjects made more DL responses on the plausible addition or subtraction manipulation photos than on either of the implausible types, geometrical manipulations and shadow manipulations. Why, then, are subjects performing better than expected by either of the chance measures on the addition or subtraction manipulations and worse than expected on the airbrushing ones? One possibility is that people’s ability to detect image manipulations is less to do with the plausibility of the change and more to do with the amount of physical change caused by the manipulation. We now look at this hypothesis in more detail by exploring the relationship between the image metrics and people’s ability to identify manipulated photos.\nFig. 7 figure7 Mean proportion of manipulated photos accurately detected and accurately located (DL), accurately detected, inaccurately located (DnL), inaccurately detected, accurately located (nDL), and inaccurately detected, inaccurately located (nDnL) by manipulation type. The dotted horizontal lines on the bars represent chance performance for each manipulation type from the results of the Monte Carlo simulation. The full horizontal lines on the bars represent chance performance for each manipulation type based on subjects’ responses on the original image trials. Error bars represent 95% CIs\nFull size image\nImage metrics and accuracy # Recall that the results from Experiment 1 suggested a relationship between the correct detection and location of image manipulations and the amount of disruption the manipulations had caused to the underlying structure of the pixels. Yet, the JPEG format of the images used in Experiment 1 created some (re-compression) noise in the Delta-E measurements between different images; thus, we wanted to test whether the same finding held with the lossless image format used in Experiment 2. As shown in Fig. 8, we found that the Delta-E measure was positively correlated with the proportion of photos that subjects correctly detected as manipulated (r(28) = 0.80, p \u0026lt; 0.001) and the proportion of manipulations that were correctly located (r(28) = 0.73, p \u0026lt; 0.001). These Pearson correlation coefficients are larger than those in Experiment 1 (cf. detect r = 0.34 and locate r = 0.41 in Experiment 1). It is possible that the re-compression noise in the JPEG images in Experiment 1 obscured the relationship between Delta-E and detection and localization performance. To check whether there was a stronger relationship between Delta-E and people’s ability to detect and locate image manipulations in Experiment 2 than Experiment 1, we converted the correlation coefficients to z values using Fisher’s transformation. There was a significantly stronger correlation between the Delta-E and detection in Experiment 2 than in Experiment 1: z = −2.74, p = 0.01. Yet because we had good reason to predict a stronger relationship in Experiment 2 than Experiment 1 (based on the JPEG re-compression noise), it might be fairer to consider the p value associated with a one-tailed test, p = 0.003. The correlation between Delta-E and accurate localization was not significantly stronger in Experiment 2 than in Experiment 1 based on a two-tailed test (z = −1.81, p = 0.07), but was based on a one-tailed test (p = 0.04). Therefore, it is possible that the global (re-compression) noise in the Delta-E values in Experiment 1 weakened the association between the amount of change and people’s ability to identify manipulations. This finding suggests that Delta-E is a more useful measure for local, discrete changes to an image than it is for global image changes, such as applying a filter.\nFig. 8 figure8 Mean proportion of correctly detected (a) and located (b) image manipulations by extent of pixel distortion as measured by Delta-E. The graphs show individual data points for each of the 30 manipulated images\nFull size image Of course, the whole point of manipulating images is to fool observers, to make them believe that something fake is in fact true. Therefore, it might not be particularly surprising to learn that people find it difficult to spot high quality image manipulations. Yet it is surprising to learn that, even though our subjects never saw the same image more than once, this ability might be dependent on the amount of disruption between the original and manipulated image. The positive relationship between the accurate detection and location of manipulations and Delta-E suggests that it might be possible to develop a metric that allows for a graded prediction about people’s ability to detect and locate image manipulations. The possibility that a metric could be used to predict people’s ability to identify image manipulations is an exciting prospect; however, further research is needed to check that this finding generalizes across a wider variety of images and manipulation types. Our findings suggest that manipulation type and the technique used to create the manipulation, for instance, cloning or scaling, might be less important than the extent to which the change affects the underlying pixel structure of the image. To test this possibility, we next consider the relationship between the Delta-E values and the proportion of (a) correct detection and (b) location responses by the category of manipulation type.\nOur findings in Experiments 1 and 2 show that subjects’ ability to detect and locate image manipulations varied by manipulation type, yet, in Experiment 2 the differences were not adequately explained by the plausibility of the manipulation. That is, subjects accurately detected and located more of the addition or subtraction manipulations than the geometry, shadow, or airbrushing manipulations. One possibility is that the five categories of manipulation type introduced different amounts of change between the original and manipulated versions of the images. If so, we might expect these differences in amount of change to help explain the differences in subjects’ detection and localization rates across these categories.\nTo check this, we calculated the mean proportion of correct detections, localizations, and Delta-E values for each of the five categories of manipulation type. As Fig. 9 shows, there was a positive correlation between the amount of change and the proportion of correct detections (r(3) = 0.92, p = 0.03) and the proportion of correct localizations (r(3) = 0.95, p = 0.01). These results suggest that the differences in detection and localization rates across the five manipulation types are better accounted for by the extent of the physical change to the image caused by the manipulation, rather than the plausibility of that manipulation. Yet, given that subjects did not have the opportunity to compare the manipulated and original version of the scene, it is not entirely obvious why amount of change predicts accuracy.\nFig. 9 figure9 Mean proportion of correctly detected (a) and located (b) image manipulations by extent of pixel distortion as measured by Delta-E. The graphs show the mean values for each of the five categories of manipulation type\nFull size image Our results suggest that the amount of change between the original and manipulated versions of an image is an important factor in explaining the detectability and localization of manipulations. Next we considered whether any individual factors are associated with improved ability to detect or locate manipulations.\nFactors that mediate the ability to detect and locate manipulations # Using GEE analyses, we again explored various factors that might affect people’s ability to detect and locate manipulations. As discussed, we were able to use liberal or stringent criteria for our classification of detection and location accuracy on the manipulated image trials. Accordingly, we ran three models: the first two used the liberal classification for accuracy (and replicated the models we ran in Experiment 1), and the other examined the more stringent classification, DL. As in Experiment 1, for the detection task, we also ran two repeated measures linear regression GEE models to explore the effect of the predictor variables on signal-detection estimates d\u0026rsquo; and c. We included the same factors used in the GEE models in Experiment 1. The results of the GEE analyses are shown in Table 5.\nTable 5 Results of the GEE binary logistic and linear regression models to determine variables that predict accuracy in the detect and locate tasks\nPredictor B OR [95% CI] p Detect (DL and DnL) Response time Accuracy 0.13 1.14 [1.10, 1.18] \u0026lt;0.001 d' −0.01 0.99 [0.98, 1.01] 0.40 c 0.004 1.00 [0.99, 1.01] 0.42 General belief about percentage of images manipulated = High (71–100%) Accuracy d' 0.09 1.09 [0.97, 1.23] 0.14 c −0.04 0.96 [0.90, 1.03] 0.25 Gender = Female Accuracy −0.01 0.99 [0.86, 1.15] 0.92 d' −0.03 0.97 [0.86, 1.09] 0.60 c −0.01 0.99 [0.93, 1.06] 0.82 Interest in photography = Interested Accuracy 0.17 1.19 [1.02, 1.39] 0.03 d' 0.04 1.04 [0.92, 1.18] 0.56 c −0.05 0.95 [0.89, 1.02] 0.18 Frequency of taking photos = Daily/weekly Accuracy −0.01 0.99 [0.84, 1.17] 0.91 d' −0.07 0.93 [0.82, 1.07] 0.31 c −0.05 0.95 [0.88, 1.02] 0.18 Locate (DL and nDL) Response time 0.10 1.11 [1.08, 1.14] \u0026lt;0.001 General belief about percentage of images manipulated = High (71–100%) −0.01 0.99 [0.87, 1.12] 0.84 Gender = Female −0.10 0.91 [0.80, 1.03] 0.14 Interest in photography = Interested 0.16 1.17 [1.02, 1.34] 0.02 Frequency of taking photos = Daily/weekly −0.08 0.92 [0.80, 1.06] 0.27 Detect and locate (DL) Response time: detect 0.17 1.19 [1.15, 1.23] \u0026lt;0.001 Response time: locate 0.13 1.14 [1.11, 1.18] \u0026lt;0.001 General belief about percentage of images manipulated = High (71–100%) 0.05 1.05 [0.91, 1.20] 0.51 Gender = Female −0.13 0.88 [0.77, 1.01] 0.07 Interest in photography = Interested 0.20 1.22 [1.06, 1.41] 0.01 Frequency of taking photos = Daily/weekly −0.09 0.92 [0.78, 1.07] 0.28 B and odds ratios (OR) estimate the degree of change in (a) accuracy on the task (based on the manipulated image trials), (b) d\u0026rsquo;, or (c) c associated with one unit change in the independent variable. An odds ratio of 1 indicates no effect of the independent variable on accuracy; values of 1.5, 2.5, and 4.0 are generally considered to reflect small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively (Rosenthal, 1996). The category order for factors was set to descending to make the reference level 0. The reference groups are: General beliefs about percentage of images manipulated = Low (0–70%), Gender = Male, Interest in photography = Not Interested, Frequency of taking photos = Monthly/yearly/never. For response time (RT) we divided the data into eight equal groups with level 1 representing the slowest RTs (detect ≥47.1 s; locate ≥18.9 s) and level 8 the fastest (detect ≤8.1 s; locate ≤2.7 s). The 14 subjects who chose not to disclose their gender were excluded from these analyses, leaving a total sample of n = 645. Because we did not have a fixed number of choices per condition in the location task, we were unable to calculate the degree of change in d\u0026rsquo; or c associated with the predictor variables\nFull size table\nUsing the more liberal accuracy classification, that is, both DL and DnL responses for detection, we found that three factors had an effect on likelihood to respond correctly: response time, general beliefs about the prevalence of photo manipulation, and interest in photography. As in Experiment 1, faster responses were more likely to be correct than slower responses. Also replicating the finding in Experiment 1, those who believe a greater percentage of photos are digitally manipulated were slightly more likely to correctly identify manipulated photos than those who believe a lower percentage of photos are digitally manipulated. Additionally, in Experiment 2, those interested in photography were slightly more likely to identify image manipulations correctly than those who are not interested in photography. For the location task, using the more liberal accuracy classification, that is, both DL and nDL responses, we found that two factors had an effect on likelihood to respond correctly. Again there was an effect of response time: In the location task, faster responses were more likely to be correct than slower responses. Also those with an interest in photography were slightly more likely to correctly locate the manipulation within the photo than those without an interest. Next we considered whether any factors affected our more stringent accuracy classification, that is, being correct on both the detection and location tasks (DL). The results revealed an effect for two factors on likelihood to respond correctly. Specifically, there was an effect of response time with shorter response times being associated with greater accuracy. There was also an effect of interest in photography, with those interested more likely to correctly make DL responses than those not interested.\nOur GEE models in both Experiments 1 and 2 revealed that shorter response times were linked with more correct responses on both tasks. As in Experiment 1, this association might be explained by several models of perceptual decision making; however, determining which of these models best accounts for our data is beyond the scope of the current paper.\nGeneral discussion # In two separate experiments we have shown, for the first time, that people’s ability to detect manipulated photos of real-world scenes is extremely limited. Considering the prevalence of manipulated images in the media, on social networking sites, and in other domains, our findings warrant concern about the extent to which people may be frequently fooled in their daily lives. Furthermore, we did not find any strong evidence to suggest that individual factors, such as having an interest in photography or beliefs about the extent of image manipulation in society, are associated with improved ability to detect or locate manipulations.\nRecall that we looked at two categories of manipulations—implausible and plausible—and we predicted that people would perform better on implausible manipulations because these scenes provide additional evidence that people can use to determine if a photo has been manipulated. Yet the story was not so simple. In Experiment 1, subjects correctly detected more of the implausible photo manipulations than the plausible photo manipulations, but in Experiment 2, the opposite was true. Further, even when subjects correctly identified the implausible photo manipulations, they did not necessarily go on to accurately locate the manipulation. It is clear that people find it difficult to detect and locate manipulations in real-world photos, regardless of whether those manipulations lead to physically plausible or implausible scenes.\nResearch in the vision science literature may help to account for these findings. We know that people might have a simplified understanding of the physics in our world (Cavanagh, 2005; Mamassian, 2008). Studies have shown, for instance, that the human visual system is relatively insensitive to the physically impossible cast shadows created by inconsistent lighting in a scene (Ostrovsky, Cavanagh, \u0026amp; Sinha, 2005). It is not necessarily the case that people ignore shadows altogether, but rather that the visual system processes shadows rapidly and uses them only as a generic cue. Put simply, as long as the shadow is roughly correct then we accept it as being authentic (Bonfiglioli, Pavani, \u0026amp; Castiello, 2004; Ostrovsky et al., 2005; Rensink \u0026amp; Cavanagh, 2004). Similarly, people use shortcuts to interpret geometrical aspects of a scene; if the geometry is close enough to people’s expectation, then it is accepted as accurate (Bex, 2010; Howe \u0026amp; Purves, 2005; Mamassian, 2008). Furthermore, the change blindness literature also highlights people’s insensitivity to shadow information. Research has shown that people are slower to detect changes to cast shadows than changes to objects (Wright, 2005), even when the shadow changes affect the overall meaning of the scene (Ehinger, Allen, \u0026amp; Wolfe, 2016). It follows, then, that when trying to distinguish between real and manipulated images, our subjects do not seem to have capitalized on the evidence in the implausible manipulation photos to determine whether they were authentic. It remains to be determined whether it is possible to train people to make use of physically implausible inconsistencies; perhaps one possibility would entail “teaching” the visual system to make full use of physical properties of the world as opposed to automatically simplifying them.\nAlthough the plausibility of a manipulation might not be so important when it comes to detecting manipulated images, we found that the extent to which the manipulation disrupts the underlying structure of the pixels might be important. Indeed, we found a positive correlation between the image metric (Delta-E) we used to measure the difference between our original and manipulated photos and the likelihood that the photo was correctly classified as manipulated. In other words, the manipulations that created the most change in the underlying pixel values of the photo were most likely to be correctly classified as manipulated. Of course, from the perspective of signal detection theory, it follows that adding greater signal results in greater detection of that signal (Green \u0026amp; Swets, 1966; Wilken \u0026amp; Ma, 2004).\nAlthough this might seem intuitive, recall that our subjects never saw the same scene more than once. That is, they never saw the non-manipulated versions of any of the manipulated photos that they were shown; despite this, their ability to detect the manipulated photos was related to the extent of change in the pixels. It seems possible that our subjects might have been able to compare the manipulated photo with their expectations about what the scene “should” look like in terms of scene statistics. In doing this, subjects might have found the manipulated photos with less change, and thus smaller Delta-E values, were more similar to their prior expectations of what the world looks like—resulting in those photos being incorrectly accepted as authentic more often. At the same time, the manipulated photos with more change, and thus larger Delta-E values, may have been more difficult to match to a prior expectation—resulting in these photos more often being correctly identified as manipulated. It seems that this difference in ease of finding a match to prior knowledge and expectation for the manipulated photo helped subjects to make an accurate decision. If this is the case, then one might speculate that it could be possible to develop a metric that will predict people’s ability to detect and locate manipulations of real-world scenes. A future investigation using a wider range of stimuli where subjects see more than one of each manipulation type might consider whether there is an interaction between Delta-E and manipulation type.\nOn a different note, our research highlights a potential opportunity to improve people’s ability to spot manipulations. In Experiment 2, we were able to compare subjects’ ability on the two tasks: detection and location. We were surprised to find that subjects performed better on the location task than on the detection task. Although this is an interesting finding, the reason for it is not immediately apparent. One possibility is that these two tasks might encourage subjects to adopt different strategies and that subjects are better at the more direct task of locating manipulations than the generic one of detecting whether a photo has been manipulated or not.\nOur research provides a first look at people’s ability to detect and locate manipulations of real-world images. A strength of the current method—applying each of the five different manipulation types to the same image—is that we know the differences in subjects’ performance is owing to the manipulation itself rather than the specific image. A drawback, however, is that the difficulty of finding or generating a set of suitable images that allowed all of the manipulation types to be applied reduced the total number of photos that could be tested to some degree. Although, ideally, future work might extend the range of images tested, we nonetheless note the close consistency in results that we obtained across the two different and independent image sets used in Experiments 1 and 2.\nFuture research might also investigate potential ways to improve people’s ability to spot manipulated photos. However, our findings suggest that this is not going to be a straightforward task. We did not find any strong evidence to suggest there are individual factors that improve people’s ability to detect or locate manipulations. That said, our findings do highlight various possibilities that warrant further consideration, such as training people to make better use of the physical laws of the world, varying how long people have to judge the veracity of a photo, and encouraging a more careful and considered approach to detecting manipulations. What our findings have shown is that a more careful search of a scene, at the very least, may encourage people to be skeptical about the veracity of photos. Of course, increased skepticism is not perfect because it comes with an associated cost: a loss of faith in authentic photos. Yet, until we know more about how to improve people’s ability to distinguish between real and fake photos, a skeptical approach might be wise, especially in contexts such as law, scientific publication, and photojournalism where even a small manipulation can have ethically significant consequences.\nBut what should we be skeptical about? Are some changes acceptable and others not? Should the context of the manipulation be taken into account? Though we are unable to answer these complex questions here, we can offer some points for thought. Although it is true that all image manipulations are to some extent deceptive, not all manipulations are intentionally deceptive. This distinction is an important one and raises the possibility that people do not set out to detect all image manipulations but instead are primarily concerned about forgeries that have been created with the intention to deceive the viewer. Of course, people might expect that all images provided as evidence, for instance news images, to have been subjected to rigorous validation processes. It is unlikely, however, that people set themselves the same standard for detecting manipulation in every day contexts. Perhaps more important than being able to identify all instances of manipulation, people are most concerned about the extent to which they can trust the message conveyed from the image. Although this poses an interesting question, our results suggest that people might struggle to detect image manipulations based on either of these definitions. In the current research, not only did subjects find it difficult to accurately locate the specific aspects of the image that had been altered, they also found it difficult to distinguish original, truthful photos from manipulated, untruthful ones.\nIn light of the findings presented in this paper, it is not surprising that World Press Photo have introduced a computerized photo-verification test to their annual photo contest. But at the end of the day, this is only a competition. What do our findings mean for other contexts in which an incorrect decision about the veracity of a photo can have devastating consequences? Essentially, our results suggest that guidelines and policies governing the acceptable standards for the use of photos, for example, in legal and media domains, should be updated to reflect the unique challenges of photography in the digital age. We recommend that this is done soon, and that psychological scientists work together with digital forensic experts and relevant end-users to ensure that such policies are built on sound empirical research.\nConclusions # The growing sophistication of photo-editing tools means that nearly anyone can make a convincing forgery. Despite the prevalence of manipulated photos in our everyday lives, there is a lack of research directly investigating the applied question of people’s ability to detect photo forgeries. Across two experiments, we found that people have an extremely limited ability to detect and locate manipulations of real-world scenes. Our results in Experiment 1 offer some support to the suggestion that people are better able to identify physically implausible changes than physically plausible ones. But we did not replicate this finding in Experiment 2; instead, our results indicate that the amount of change is more important than the plausibility of the change when it comes to detecting and localizing manipulations. Furthermore, we did not find any strong evidence to suggest individual factors are associated with improved ability to detect or locate manipulations. These findings offer an important first step in understanding people’s ability to identify photo forgeries, and although our results indicate that it might not be an easy task, future research should look to investigate potential ways to improve this ability. Moreover, our results highlight the need to bring current guidelines and policies governing the acceptable standards for the use of photos into the digital age.\nEndnotes # Abbreviations # CI: Confidence interval GEE: Generalized Estimating Equations JPEG: Joint Photographic Experts Group OR: Odds ratio PNG: Portable Network Graphics RT: Response time References # Amsler, M.

Spam traffic analysis is an important tool in this context, allowing network administrators to understand the behavior of spammers, both as they obfuscate messages and try to hide inside the network. This work adds to that body of information by analyzing the sources of spam to understand to what extent they explain the traffic observed. Our results show that, in many cases, an Autonomous System (AS) represents an interesting neighborhood to observe, with most ASes falling into four basic types: heavy and light senders, which tend to have many or very few spammer machines respectively, frequent small offenders, where spammer machines appear every now and then but disappear in a short time, and conniving ASes, where most machines do not send spam, but a few are heavy, continuous senders. Not only that, but also by grouping machines based on the campaigns that they send together, we define the notion of SpamBands. Those bands identify groups of machines that are probably controlled by the same spammer, and our findings show that they often span multiple ASes. The identification of AS neighborhood types and SpamBands may simplify the combat against spam, focusing efforts at the sources as a whole, possibly improving blacklists by grouping machines found in a same AS or SpamBands.\nKeywords: Spam traffic; Autonomous system; Network bad neighborhoods\nIntroduction # In the last two decades, there has been a steady increase in the use of Internet, which led to an increase of the problems related to the sending of spam messages. In addition to the large volume of data generated, since the email service providers estimate that between 40% and 80% of electronic messages are spam, many times they are related to the propagation of phishing [1] and malware [2]. Because of those factors, the losses caused by spam traffic are estimated in billions of dollars [3].\nTo try to counter those effects, the battle against spammers takes place on several fronts. For example, much has been done to develop filters based on message content, defining rules to identify patterns of obfuscation observed in spam messages [4]. Besides that, in recent years, multiple efforts have focused on understanding spam traffic within the network. The goal in that case is to find elements that can be used to identify the machines that send the messages before they traverse the network and consume resources of mail servers at the destination. This work fits in this line, analyzing where are the machines used by spammers.\nRecently, the term Internet Bad Neighborhoods was created to identify contiguous ranges of IP address space that contain a significant number of machines with unwanted behavior [5]. The principle behind the original concept was that machines with similar (bad) behavior that shared an IP prefix would suggest they belong to a same network with problems. Later, the concept was extended to refer to network segments propagating unwanted traffic, regardless of the number of machines involved [6]. The granularity chosen for those analysis was that of /24 address ranges.\nOur analysis is based on similar principles, but we chose the level of Autonomous Systems (AS) to identify possible bad neighborhoods. Autonomous Systems, by nature, identify an IP address range under the control of a single entity responsible for defining usage policies, routing, and administrative procedures to be applied to all machines installed in that range. In this sense, two IP addresses belonging to the same AS would have a much greater chance of exhibiting similar behavior than two IP addresses on subnets with adjacent addresses (the IP space), but belonging to different ASes. After all, an AS with security flaws in its policies is at risk of becoming a potential Bad Neighborhood, since the probability of machines belonging to that AS being infected and starting to send spam is high. It should be pointed, though, that some ASes may be under split management; that could be better treated by considering BGP announced prefixes, but that information was not available in the collected data.\nOur data contain spam traffic collected at various points around the globe, which gives us multiple vantage points over the network. By grouping the machines that generate the traffic based on their origin AS, we created a profile of the behavior of each Autonomous System observed during the experiment. Our results show that the majority of machines sending spam are concentrated in a few ASes and that only 15 of them are responsible for over 80% of the observed traffic. By using data mining techniques, we observed that there are similarities between some of them, and that it is possible to group them in four categories representing the AS from the point of view of their role in the distribution of spam. This finding is one of the main contributions of this work, since, until then, it was common to assume that there would be only two types of generators of spam: “light” and “heavy” transmitters. Our characterization indicates that in addition to spam-free and bad neighborhoods (where bad behavior — spamming — is quite common), there are also good neighborhoods, where such behavior is not the norm, but appears from time to time, usually rapidly disappearing shortly after its appearance in one or another machine, and conniving neighborhoods, where misbehaving machines were not widespread, but limited to only a few hosts, which tend, however, to be heavy senders.\nRelated work # This work analyzes spam based on its behavior as seen “inside the network”, not based on data from destination mail servers. In that sense, it relates to the works of Ramachandran and Feamster [7], one of the first to study spam from network-level features. Although we consider such features, since we have access to the spam content, we combine different views. Duan, Gopalan and Yuan [8] have recently provided a similar analysis, although based on a single point of observation (a large university campus).\nThe definition of Bad Neighborhoods, mentioned in the introduction, is due to van Wanrooij and Pras, who proposed the concept as an extension of the use of blacklists in the spam detection [5]. In their study, each 24-bit IP prefix (/24) would be a neighborhood and bad neighborhoods would be those with a large number of machines sending spam. Moreira Moura et al. [6] focused on the analysis of these neighborhoods and extended the definition to include IP networks with few transmitters, but with a high volume of traffic, following the classification of “heavy” and “light” transmitters previously proposed by Pathak, Hu and Mao [9]. In our work, we observe that each AS can be seen as a neighborhood, because an autonomous system naturally defines an area with similar machines, since there is a unique management for the whole AS and a common routing policy for all machines.\nMany studies analyze spam traffic using messages collected at the destination mail servers. Gomes et al. [10] showed features that can be used to separate legitimate messages from spam messages, using data collected from only one specific point of the network. In this work, spam messages were collected by low-interaction honeypots installed in 10 different countries and located in transit networks. This provided a more global view of spam traffic, offering a different perspective.\nKokkodis and Faloutsos [11] showed results that indicate that the activities of botnets are scattered in the IP address space, reducing the effectiveness of anti-spam filters based on addresses and hindering the work of network administrators. Our work, despite confirming the existence of spammers in a very large number of networks, shows that most of the spam messages come from a small number of ASes, a result that can be used in the development of new techniques for spam detection, as in the design of initiatives to act against such sources.\nSome of our analysis is based on the concept of spam campaigns. Our definition is based on the identification of frequent patterns in the content, using data mining techniques [12]. Other approaches have been proposed, like the use of regular expressions [13]. Our approach fits better with our processing pipeline, where multiple data mining algorithms are applied to derive different views, such as those in this paper.\nThis paper is based on previous work, so far available only in Portuguese. In a first paper [14], we performed a detailed analysis of spam messages collected over three months around the world to observe Bad Neighborhoods. With the same dataset, we developed the concept of SpamBands [15], another way to analyze the origin of spammers. (All the major concepts from those papers are included here, to provide a complete source in English). In the current work we extend our analysis of both concepts to cover data from approximately one year, and for the first time we use both concepts, Neighborhoods and SpamBands, to study the relationship between them. That allowed us to identify new patterns, such as the strong correlation between IP addresses in SpamBands and bad neighborhoods, and a topological relationship among spammers, since the IP addresses from a SpamBand usually come from just a few ASes. We hope that our findings can help drive the spam community’s efforts to combat spammers closer to their origin.\nMethodology # Three aspects of our methodology deserve attention: the collection architecture, and our techniques to identify spam campaigns, and to define SpamBands. They are presented next.\nCollection infrastructure # The dataset used in this work was collected using twelve low-interaction honeypots [16] installed in ten different country codes: two in Brazil, two in the United States and one in each of Argentina, Australia, Austria, Ecuador, Netherlands, Norway, Taiwan and Uruguay. That means we had collectors present in four different continents, allowing the study to have a global view of spam traffic. By doing that, we avoided the problem of location bias, which may be present in several studies in the literature, whose data often come from a single collection point. Furthermore, none of the honeypots used in the analysis showed any signs of having been subjected to any form of attack.\nThe honeypots used in this paper are machines that simulate machines of interest to spammers, such as open SMTP mail relays and HTTP and SOCKS open proxies. Their goal is to lure spammers to identify them as vulnerable machines and use them to try to deliver spam messages. In practice, the honeypots do not deliver spam messages to the intended recipients; instead, they are stored locally and periodically collected to a central storage. The behavior of honeypots, however, is such that it makes the spammer believe that the delivery was successful. That is corroborated by the fact that each most machines continues to abuse the honeypots for all the collection period.\nIt should be noted that our analysis is guided by the traffic that was directed to our honeypots. There may be spammers that do not make use of proxies/relays to deliver their messages, and those are not considered in this analysis. However, is highly unlikely that a heavy spammer, using a dedicated server farm, would remain in activity without such a technique: it would be easily identified by black lists and blocked, since it uses few origin IP addresses. On the other hand, if a botnet delivers spam directly to the target mail servers all the time, we would not see it in our data.\nAlong with each message received, additional information is collected and stored by the system. This information includes the protocol used by the spammer to connect to the honeypot, (SMTP, HTTP or SOCKS), the network prefix and AS of origin, the status of the source IP in blacklists like Spamhaus XBL and PBL at the moment each message was delivered, among others. All that is obtained at the time the message is received, so that we have a snapshot of things as they were at the moment the spammer tried to send each message. Thus, our analysis considers the information available at the time of the transmission and not during a later query, which could cause error. That is essential, for example, for the analysis of black list contents, which might change between the time of collection and analysis.\nLater, during the analysis, some ASes deserved further study. In those cases, based on their AS numbers, we gathered data available on the Internet to get more details about their activities. Based on the activities that were identified during that search, we classified the ASes as providers (general, DSL, corporative), hosting/co-location services, etc.\nSpam campaigns and spam bands # To better understand the behavior of spammers, we used the concept of spam campaigns. A campaign is a set of messages that share a common goal (similar content) and a common dissemination strategy [12]. We used the FPCluster algorithm to group messages based on their various attributes and to identify the obfuscation strategies used. That algorithm builds a frequent pattern tree, which is then used to extract the message clustering patterns, which in turn identify the campaigns [12,17].\nThrough the identification of campaigns, we detect the influence of each orchestrated campaign on the spam traffic collected, as well as the emergence of new IP addresses that join a given campaign. Based on those observations, Fazzion et al. [15] developed a method that can identify groups of transmitters that are correlated, called SpamBands. Since that work was published in Portuguese, the method is described here for completeness.\nThe premise of SpamBands was that machines which generate the same campaigns are controlled by the same orchestrator, being related in terms of dissemination strategy used. Thus, a SpamBand is a group of machines that works together on the same set of campaigns. The relationship between machines and campaigns can be modeled as a graph G, where the machines are vertices and there is an edge between two machines if they sent messages associated with the same campaign. Figure 1 illustrates the construction of this graph.\nFigure 1 figure1 SpamBand graph construction. The graph represents IP addresses that sent spam as vertices. There is an edge between two vertices if they took part in the same spam campaign.\nFull size image From G, we can define a SpamBand as a dense sub-graph that can be obtained by several clustering algorithms in graphs in the literature which can be quite complex and hard to calibrate [18]. Our strategy is more simple and interactive. Initially, each SpamBand is a connected component.\nIn some cases, however, one IP address may be found connected to more than one such sub-graph. That may be due to IP address reassignment, or use of NAT. To handle that, in a second moment, we evaluate those cases, which can require the split of certain connected components in order to isolate subgraphs with higher density.\nThe process to identify SpamBands is presented in Algorithm 1. The algorithm receives three parameters: the graph (G), the minimum threshold betweenness to be considered (threshold_bt) and the maximum number of IP addresses that can be removed in order to split a connected component (threshold_ips).\nAlgorithm 1: SpamBand (Graph G, Float threshold_bt, Float threshold_ips)\nS = ∅; C=G.ConnectedComponents(); ; for comp in C do ips_to_remove = ∅ ; for ip in comp do if ip.Betweenness() \u0026gt; threshold_bt*comp.BiggestBetweenness() then ips_to_remove.Add(ip); end end if ips_to_remove.size() \u0026gt; threshold_ips*comp.NodesNumber() then S += comp; end else S += comp.RemoveNodes(ips_to_remove); end end return S; The first step is to determine the connected components in G which constitute the initial approximation of the SpamBands. Next, we identify dense sub-graphs in each connected component exploring the betweenness concept, which measures the centrality degree of a node in the graph. This metric indicates the number of shortest paths among all pair of nodes in the graph that pass through a given node. Our premise is that when some nodes have a high value of betweenness, beyond what would be expected for a strongly connected graph, chances are that those nodes are connecting two (or more) sub-graphs which are, themselves, internally dense. Thus, by removing those nodes, we are emphasizing the separation of those internally dense sub-graphs. This removal is based on the parameters threshold_bt, which is the lower bound of betweenness that a node may have in order to be removed, and threshold_ips, which defines a maximum threshold of the number of nodes that can be removed in order to split a component. Algorithm 1 initially verifies which nodes satisfy the betweenness threshold in each connected component and next verifies if their removal does not lead very small graphs. If it is possible to remove the nodes, each resultant component is inserted in S. If not, the current component is inserted in S. The algorithm returns the set S which holds all SpamBands.\nCollected data # Our analysis considers approximately one year of collection, from May 9, 2012, until March 31, 2013, resulting in nearly four billion messages (14 TB). By analyzing a large period, we avoid any impact due to an atypical behavior, which could occur in a short period of time.\nTable 1 shows an overview of the data collected by the twelve honeypots and used in the study, broken down by the protocol used by the spammers. During the period of almost a year, 3.97 billion messages were collected, which correspond to 14 TB of data. The addresses of the machines that sent spam were associated with 149 different country codes, which corresponded to about 60% of all country codes. We can also notice a large number of autonomous systems, 3,226, showing that the collection included many subnets of origin.\nTable 1 Global vision of the data\nSMTP SOCKS HTTP Total Messages (x106) 690 (17.4%) 2,486 (62.5%) 799 (20.1%) 3,976 IP addresses 294,072 34,397 11,449 328,050 Autonomous systems 3,096 443 55 3,226 Country codes 146 66 14 149 Volume (GB) 2,564 8,522 3,378 14,464 Full size table\nThe number of IP addresses using SOCKS and HTTP protocol is much smaller when compared to the number of IP addresses that used the SMTP protocol. Nevertheless, the number of messages sent using HTTP and SOCKS is larger. This shows that there is not a direct relationship between the number of machines and the number of messages sent. This division is a sign of the differentiation between spammers: some adopt strategies based on high volume over a certain protocol, while others may send lower volumes, using more machines, over another protocol. In fact, during our analysis we will see that there are more factors to be considered.\nNeighborhood analysis # In this work, we advocate that ASes can be used for the identification of the limits of the neighborhoods, instead of /24 prefixes, as used in the original definition [5]. That provides a more natural aggregation of addresses, given that fixed-length prefixes are not adequate for all cases.\nTo show that, in Table 1 we observe that spam messages come from many different networks, since 3,226 distinct autonomous systems appeared in the collected data. It is interesting to notice that most of those spam messages were sent by a very small number of autonomous systems, being fifty of them responsible for over 85% of all traffic. Thus, analyzing the behavior of spam at the source can direct the efforts to fight spam as it can identify which are the neighborhoods that have worst behavior, and, consequently, that are more likely to send spam messages.\nDistribution of IP addresses in autonomous systems # Figure 2(a) shows that for the majority of Autonomous Systems, only a few devices were seen contacting the honeypots. In almost 90% of the ASes, the number of machines observed was smaller than 20. In Table 2, we can clearly see the existence of a large group of AS with a small number of IP addresses sending spam messages and another group, smaller, which contains most of those addresses. This shows that the machines that send spam messages are not evenly distributed across the Autonomous Systems.\nFigure 2 figure2 Distribution of active IP numbers per AS, as well as the distribution of the number of IPs from an AS present in the XBL, PBL black lists (or not present in any BL).(a) CDF of the number of IP addresses per AS. (b) CDF of the percentage of IP addresses in XBL per AS. (c) CDF of the percentage of IP addresses in PBL per AS. (d) CDF of the percentage of IP addresses that are not in any blacklist per AS.\nFull size image Table 2 Number of IP addresses observed per AS\nIP addr. per AS (x) #AS #Msgs (x106) #IP addr. x = 1 1,581 (49.0%) 108 (2.7%) 1,581 (0.5%) x \u0026lt;10 2,705 (83.9%) 305 (7.7%) 5,635 (1.7%) x \u0026lt;50 3,061 (94.9%) 797 (20.0%) 13,309 (4.6%) x \u0026lt;100 3,131 (97.1%) 1,150 (28.9%) 18,159 (5.5%) x ≥ 100 95 (2.9%) 2,825 (71.1%) 319,554 (97.4%) Full size table\nThose ASes that have fewer than 10 machines that send spam, account for over 83% of the total. Nevertheless, they send only 7.66% of the messages and correspond in number of machines to 1.7% of the total. Thus, we believe that in terms of neighborhoods, these AS are not characterized as bad neighborhoods, but that their security policies are being implemented correctly, because of the small number of spamming IP addresses and the low volume of traffic generated by them. On the other hand, 95 autonomous systems (2.94%) have more than 319,000 IP addresses in the dataset (97.41%) and are responsible for 71% of traffic from spam, which corresponds to almost 3 billion messages. Those neighborhoods show bad behavior, possibly due to weak security policies. Thus, direct efforts to understand and improve the behavior of those networks might have impact on the overall traffic.\nFigure 2 also shows the distribution of IP addresses present in each blacklist. The two black lists considered here are XBL, which lists IP addresses detected as infected, and PBL, which lists IP ranges declared by ISPs as being used for dynamic hosts — which should not send mail directly. Finally, we consider IPs that were not found in any of the blacklists considered (No BL). There is a very small number of Autonomous Systems that do not have IP addresses in XBL, about 15%, as we can see in Figure 2(b). In addition, approximately 60% of the ASes have all their IP addresses in XBL. This result makes us believe that most IP addresses are detected by the XBL, but what happens is that a good portion of the ASes listed there (49%) have only one spamming IP address (therefore, 100% of their addresses are in the XBL).\nConsidering that, the information about the IP addresses that are in the PBL and those who do not participate in any blacklist (nobl) end up getting distorted, as shown in Figures 2 (c) and 2 (d). In the graph of Figure 2 (c), for example, more than 70% of autonomous systems have no IP address present in the PBL, but more than 85% of IP addresses found in the period of analysis are in PBL as shown in Table 3. The IP addresses that are not in any blacklist, belong mostly to a few ASes, and represent a very small portion of the IP addresses, less than 12%. However, this small number of machines is responsible for over 68% of all spam traffic, as shown in Table 3.\nTable 3 Overview of blacklists\n#IP addresses #Messages (106) XBL 66,388 (20.2%) 594 (14.9%) PBL 282,599 (86.2%) 789 (19.8%) No BL 41,005 (12.5%) 2,714 (68.3%) Full size table\nAnalysis of neighborhoods with higher transmission power # Table 4 shows the 15 ASes that sent the most spam messages in the period analyzed, being, by themselves, responsible for more than 80% of all spam traffic. This information can be incorporated into spam filters and used by network administrators to reduce the volume of spam, since messages sent by those AS tend to be spam. By analyzing them, in spite of the fact that all send a large volume of spam, we see that there are some neighborhoods that have very different characteristics from each other. On the other hand, it is possible to notice that some of them are very similar, although they have no direct relationship.\nTable 4 15 most important autonomous systems\nAS Msgs (106) IP addr.

They have a small number of IP addresses in our dataset, most of them using SOCKS and HTTP protocols to send spam, and do not belong to any blacklist. AS 2497 is also very similar, despite having a larger number of machines. AS 4725, in turn, differs only by having a large number of IP addresses in PBL blacklist. The machines of those neighborhoods behave like dedicated servers used to send spam: they use SOCKS and HTTP protocols, meaning they do not contact any mail host directly (only through proxies), each sends a large number of messages, and most of them are not in any blacklist.\nIn contrast, we find some neighborhoods with completely different characteristics, such as Autonomous Systems 3462 and 4134. Both have more than 100,000 IP addresses in our dataset, the vast majority of machines observed used the SMTP protocol to send spam and most of them were in some blacklist. In addition, AS 4134 has very striking features, with more than 99% of their IP addresses sending spam messages using the SMTP protocol and about 17,000 of them in XBL.\nGrouping of autonomous systems # Because of the evidence mentioned in Section 5.2, we looked for a way to group the AS observed and classify them according to their characteristics. For this, we use the X-means clustering algorithm [19], considering the characteristics of each neighborhood as attributes. The algorithm has the quality of automatically setting the optimum number of clusters to use, unlike other clustering algorithms.\nTo perform the clustering, we used as features the characteristics that better represent the Autonomous Systems in our analysis. The attributes carry information such as number of IP addresses observed, number of messages per day, percentage of the IP addresses in blacklists, percentage of IP addresses using each protocol, and the average number of messages sent per IP address. Those attributes proved to be a good set to identify the neighborhoods, because they define the major elements of behavior that machines on those networks can present.\nTable 5 exhibits the properties of each of the four groups generated. Group 1 contains 64% of the ASes, and most of them have a very small number of observed IP addresses. Most of the machines in that group use SMTP protocol and are in XBL. Group 2 also has a small number of IP addresses, but it is responsible for most of the spam sent (65%). In addition, more than 98% of the messages were sent using SOCKS and HTTP protocols, although most of the IP addresses (84%) use the SMTP protocol to send spam. The vast majority of messages (97%) was sent by machines that were not in any blacklist. Group 3 differs from the others because more than 99% of its IP addresses sent messages through the SMTP protocol and most of them are in PBL and XBL. Finally, the fourth group contains the ASes with a large number of machines observed in the dataset. The majority of their IP addresses are in PBL, and only a smaller number is in XBL. Although most of the machines used SMTP, the highest volume of spam was sent using the SOCKS protocol.\nTable 5 Features of each group\nGroup 1 Group 2 Group 3 Group 4 ASes 2,064 449 359 354 Msgs (x106 ) 379 2,602 88 907 No. IP Addresses 8,426 16,024 11,503 301,760 Msgs/IP (x103) 45.0 162.4 7.6 3.0 Activity1 48.8 63.4 67.1 85.3 Msgs-SMTP 85.3% 1.5% 71.4% 29.2% Msgs-SOCKS 13.5% 75.3% 23.2% 50.3% Msgs-HTTP 1.2% 23.2% 5.4% 20.5% Msgs-Xbl 81.9% 1.7% 68.6% 20.0% Msgs-Pbl 2.8% 1.4% 52.0% 76.8% Msgs-No-Bl 17.2% 97.2% 15.0% 11.7% IPs-Xbl 83.5% 13.2% 64.7% 16.5% IPs-Pbl 5.2% 12.9% 86.6% 89.5% IPs-No-Bl 15.2% 77.7% 7.1% 8.8% Volume (TB) 1.2 7.55 0.36 4.98 IPs-SMTP 97.43% 84.62% 99.19% 89.01% IPs-SOCKS 2.67% 15.27% 0.82% 11.12% IPs-HTTP 0.33% 9.52% 0.02% 3.44% 1 Average of days, in the analyzed period, in which the machines of this group were active.\nFull size table If we consider the neighborhoods that sent more spam messages, studied in Section 5.2, we see that the clustering placed ASes with similar characteristics in the same group, and separated those with different behaviors. Autonomous Systems 10297, 29802, and 2497, whose machines behave like dedicated servers, ended up in group 2, responsible for most of the spam traffic, even though having fewer IP addresses. Moreover, that group has few machines in blacklists, which is a necessary feature for machines that send a large volume of messages — otherwise they would not be effective.\nMost machines from Autonomous Systems 3462 and 4134 behave like bots and those two neighborhoods are part of the Group 4. That group includes ASes that have a large number of IP addresses with most of them in blacklists. It is also observed that most of the IP addresses in that group sent a small amount of messages.\nBy analyzing the 15 neighborhoods highlighted in Section 5.2, we found that none of them are in groups 1 or 3, as can be seen in Table 4. This result was already expected, since the ASes in group 1 have a very small number of IP addresses and those from group 3 have few machines that send spam and are responsible for few spam messages. Thus, the neighborhoods that send more spam were allocated to the other two groups: ASes that have a lot of IP addresses and those that send a large amount of spam messages.\nWe believe these results may be used in at least two important ways: to help guide policies used by different network managers in the way they treat data from ASes known to fall into a certain class, and to help the network community to identify organizations that may be in need of some orientation on how to handle their security (those with a large number of low volume spamming IPs), or those that may require some pressure to act against server-heady spammers that may be among their clients.\n5.3.1 Group 1 # The graph in Figure 3(a) shows that a very small percentage of the neighborhoods of this group use the SOCKS and HTTP protocols to send spam messages and that over 70% of the AS send less than 100 thousand of messages in the period. Although the number of messages is small, given that we collected for almost one year, we can see in Table 5 that this group had a very small number of IP addresses observed, resulting in a relatively high number of messages by IP address.\nFigure 3 figure3 Distribution of messages sent and active IP numbers for ASes in group 1. (a) CDF of the number of messages sent per AS. (b) CDF of the number of IP addresses per AS.\nFull size image The main characteristic of the ASes of this group is the small number of spamming machines, as we can see in Figure 3(b). Almost 60% of the Autonomous Systems here have only a single IP address in the dataset and none of them have more than one hundred IP addresses. This explains why that group, even encompassing 64% of the AS, is responsible for only 9.5% of the spam traffic generated. Furthermore, most of the IP addresses in this group are in XBL blacklist, which characterizes infected machines, probably belonging to botnets.\nThe activity period of the machines in the AS of this group show constant activity using the SMTP protocol in almost all ASes, as shown in Figure 4(a). On the other hand, the graph of Figure 4(c) shows that few ASes use the HTTP protocol and only one used this protocol for more than ten days. This large amount of messages sent by SMTP protocol, along with a high number of IP addresses in XBL, suggests the existence of bots. As there are few committed IP addresses in these AS, it is possible that those machines constitute exceptions in the security policy of an overall secure system and that, for some reason, go unnoticed to the management of these networks.\nFigure 4 figure4 Activity of Autonomous Systems in group 1, per protocol.

There is a mark at position (x,y) if AS y was active on date x.\nFull size image\n5.3.2 Group 2 # This group contains the ASes that sent more spam messages and together they are responsible for more than 65% of all messages. As shown in Figure 5(a), 5% of the ASes sent more than one million messages and are responsible for most of the spam traffic. In this group, almost no message is sent using the SMTP protocol, since 98% of the messages were sent by SOCKS and HTTP protocols.\nFigure 5 figure5 Distribution of messages sent and active IP numbers for ASes in group 2. (a) CDF of the number of messages sent per AS. (b) CDF of the number of IP addresses per AS.\nFull size image The Autonomous Systems in this group also have a small number of spamming IP addresses — 57% of them had only one IP address in the dataset. Moreover, a very small percentage of neighborhoods here (2%) have more than one hundred machines. However, even with a small number of IP addresses, the average number of spam messages sent by each of them is very large, more than 162 thousand, as can be seen in Table 5. Those features (few machines, with heavy spam traffic) suggest that most of the ASes here house machines that act as dedicated servers to send spam, probably with the connivance of the network administrators. In our opinion, an unwanted bot that would start behaving that way would not go unnoticed by a network administrator that did not accept such practice, and it would not remain limited to a few machines if the network administrator was careless enough not to bother about it. One final interesting aspect is that, in this group, most of the IP addresses are not in any blacklist. Considering the volume of traffic they generate, that would only be possible if they consistently abuse intermediary machines to hide from blacklist detection.\nCompared to the other groups, the period of activity of the AS using SOCKS and HTTP protocols are higher in this group. We can see that there is a larger number of ASes and they remain active for a longer period, as the graphics of Figure 6 clearly shows.\nFigure 6 figure6 Activity of Autonomous Systems in group 2, per protocol. (a) SMTP. (b) SOCKS. (c) HTTP. ASes appear ordered in the y axis. There is a mark at position (x,y) if AS y was active on date x.\nFull size image As mentioned earlier, ASes 10297, 29802 and 2497 were assigned to this group. Like others in the group, that were studied, those AS are characterized by offering hosting and co-location services, which would fit the profile just described.\n5.3.3 Group 3 # Table 5 shows that in this group, over 70% of spam messages were sent using the SMTP protocol and the ASes of the group are responsible for only 2.2% of all messages. The graph in Figure 7(a) shows that over 80% of the neighborhoods here sent less than 200,000 messages, explaining the fact that this group is responsible for a smaller number of messages.\nFigure 7 figure7 Distribution of messages sent and active IP numbers for ASes in group 3. (a) CDF of the number of messages sent per AS. (b) CDF of the number of IP addresses per AS.\nFull size image The graph in Figure 7(b) shows a similar behavior to that seen in groups 1 and 2, but the number of ASes with only one IP address is lower, just under 40%. What marks this group is the large number of IP addresses that use the SMTP protocol, over 99% of them, surpassing any other group. In addition, about 64% of the machines in this group are in XBL. This suggests the presence of bots, but the low number of IP addresses suggests that there are fewer compromised machines in those AS.\nThe graph in Figure 8(c) shows that only one AS of this group sent spam messages by HTTP protocol, and just for a short period of time. As expected, for the SMTP protocol, all the ASes were very active throughout the period, as seen in Figure 8(a).\nFigure 8 figure8 Activity of Autonomous Systems in group 3, per protocol.(a) SMTP. (b) SOCKS. (c) HTTP. ASes appear ordered in the y axis. There is a mark at position (x,y) if AS y was active on date x.\nFull size image\n5.3.4 Group 4 # From Figure 9(a) we can see that most of the ASes in this group used the SMTP protocol to send spam, but the few Autonomous Systems using SOCKS and HTTP protocols sent more than one million messages. The neighborhoods of this group are responsible for about 23% of all spam traffic.\nFigure 9 figure9 Distribution of messages sent and active IP numbers for ASes in group 4. (a) CDF of the number of messages sent per AS. (b) CDF of the number of IP addresses per AS.\nFull size image This group contains the ASes with the larger numbers of machines observed, as can be seen in Figure 9(b), with over 20% of neighborhoods with over 1,000 IP addresses, in which some of them have more than 100,000 machines. Thus, even accounting for much of the spam traffic, the number of spam messages per IP address is the lowest among the groups, only 3,000. Moreover, the great majority of the IP address are in blacklists and use the SMTP protocol. For all this, we have strong evidence that many of the machines belonging to this group are part of botnets. Because of the large number of machines in this situation, these AS are classified of bad neighborhoods, where, apparently, management policies and network maintenance are not able to prevent the proliferation of infected machines.\nBecause the ASes in this group have a very large number of IP addresses, it is common for the same AS to show the use of the three different protocols in the dissemination of spam. This behavior is explained by Figures 10(b) and 10(c). It was expected an intense period of activity in the use of the SMTP protocol, once machines belonging to botnets tend to use this protocol. Therefore, the graph of Figure 10(a) reinforces the suspicious about botnets.\nFigure 10 figure10 Activity of Autonomous Systems in group 4, per protocol. (a) SMTP. (b) SOCKS. (c) HTTP. ASes appear ordered in the y axis. There is a mark at position (x,y) if AS y was active on date x.\nFull size image ASes 3462 and 4134, which are part of this group, have been classified as ISPs with DSL networks. This suggests that the composition of this group is predominantly domestic users machines infected by some type of malware.\nSpamBands analysis # We applied the SpamBand identification algorithm described in Section 3 to the data from each honeypot. We found a total of 2618 SpamBands and the distribution of those among the honeypots is shown in Figure 11(a). This Figure reinforces the notion of orchestration by spammers: all honeypots have a well-defined range of SpamBands that attacked them each day, and the increase and decrease in the number of SpamBands in that interval suggests an orchestration in order to obfuscate the action of groups of spammers.\nFigure 11 figure11 SpamBands active in various honeypots over time. (a) The number of SpamBands found each day in eight different honeypots. (b) Their linear regressions.\nFull size image Figure 11(b) shows a linear regression of the number of SpamBands per day for each honeypot. The linear trends reveal lines with low inclination (almost constant) adding to the impression that the variation observed in Figure 11(a) is regular and is due to some kind of obfuscation. Another interesting result is about honeypot EC-01. That honeypot was attacked by more SpamBands than any other, although no clear reason for that was found.\nFigure 12(a) shows that only 5% of SpamBands using SOCKS or HTTP have more than 100 IP addresses, again suggesting the use of dedicated infrastructure for sending messages. In contrast, about 30% of total SpamBands using SMTP have more than 100 IP addresses, which is not surprising, since these are supposed to be botnets that, in general, consist of a larger number of machines. Observing Figure 12(b), we see an inversion: HTTP or SOCKS SpamBands tend to send more messages than SMTP ones. This happens precisely due to the fact previously mentioned. Since those who use SOCKS or HTTP are probably dedicated servers, they use all their resources to send a large number of messages. On the other hand, those who use SMTP and are part of botnets can only send spam moderately, to avoid their identification [20].\nFigure 12 figure12 Distribution of IPs present and messages sent by SpamBands. (a) CDF of the number of IP addresses per SpamBand. (b) CDF of the number of messages sent per SpamBand.\nFull size image\nRelationship between SpamBands and ASes # In Figure 13, we can observe that the majority of SpamBands, for all protocols, have IP addresses from just a few ASes. This result indicates a topological relationship among IP addresses of a SpamBand, where machines from the same AS tend to send unwanted messages from the same set of spam campaigns. Furthermore, the small number of SpamBands that encompass IP addresses from more than 60 neighborhoods use the SMTP protocol. This result is expected, since SMTP is used by botnets, which tend to have infected machines spread over more ASes.\nFigure 13 figure13 Distribution of the number of AS per SpamBand. Show the distribution of the number of different AS that appears in a same SpamBand.\nFull size image\n6.1.1 SpamBands activities in different neighborhoods # As already mentioned, Autonomous Systems were classified in four groups, where groups 2 and 4 were considered bad neighborhoods. The results in the chart of Figure 14 shows that half of the SpamBands (about 50%) have IP addresses from Autonomous Systems that belong only to groups 2 or 4. Then come SpamBands that use both hosts in neighborhoods of type 2 and 4, and then those that use only group 1. This confirms that the ASes were classified correctly into those four groups and suggests that most of the IP addresses in SpamBands are in bad neighborhoods. Thus, this result points out that the efforts against the spam abuse have to focus in Autonomous Systems that are considered as bad neighborhoods.\nFigure 14 figure14 SpamBands distribution over neighborhood types (AS groups). Shows how SpamBands are distributed over neighborhood types (AS groups). The numbers on the x axis identify individual groups (1, 2, 3, 4) or combinations of two or three groups (e.g., 24 means a SpamBand has members in ASes in neighborhood types identified by groups 2 and 4).\nFull size image\nFurthermore, most of SpamBands that contain AS from group 2 usually use the HTTP or SOCKS protocol. This was expected, once group 2 seems to have a lot of dedicated server machines to send spam. On the other hand, the SpamBands with AS in group 4 use the SMTP protocol. This result was also expected because most machines in these neighborhoods seems to belong to botnets.\n6.1.2 SpamBands clustering # In this section we analyze the clustering coefficient inside the SpamBands to verify if IP addresses SpamBands interact more with other IP addresses in their AS than with IP addresses from others neighborhoods. The internal clustering coefficient (ICC) of a SpamBand is the average of the clustering coefficient in each AS considering only the internal connections, i.e., connections among IP addresses that belong to a same Autonomous System. On the other hand, the external clustering coefficient (ECC) of a SpamBand takes the average of the clustering coefficient in each AS considering only the external connections, i.e., connections among IP addresses of different Autonomous Systems.\nAs shown in Figure 15, 55% of the SpamBands have ICC higher than 0.3 while and only 42% have ECC higher than this value. Moreover, as we can see, the standard behavior is that each SpamBand have an ECC smaller than its ICC. We conclude that inside a SpamBand, the relationships between IP addresses which belong to a same AS are more intense. It suggests that there is a topological correlation among IP addresses inside a SpamBand, showing that Autonomous Systems are a good way to represent neighborhoods.\nFigure 15 figure15 SpamBands clustering within ASes. Verification of the clustering coefficient SpamBand graphs when considered the AS borders: average internal (within AS) and external (among ASes) clustering coefficientes.\nFull size image\nConclusions # Several efforts are under way to combat spam, but this task has been made difficult due to the technical sophistication of spammers. This paper tries to shed some light on the sources of spam messages, to help the development of techniques and policies to fight spam at its origin. Our results show that, although spam messages are being sent from various networks, most of the traffic is concentrated in a few Autonomous Systems, and that can be used to identify spam sources and fight them. Moreover, we grouped ASes into four categories based on their spam dissemination behavior. Those groups shown that we can identify good and bad neighborhoods, some with many infected machines, others with just a few on-and-off senders that get shut down quickly, other which are conniving with a few heavy spammers.\nBy identifying machines that participate together in a spam campaign (SpamBands), we observed that most campaigns originated from neighborhoods of a single type, or may include hosts in the two types of heavy sending neighborhoods at the same time. All that can be used to identify major sources of spam to help stop that kind of traffic.\nAs future work, we plan to conduct further analysis on each of the neighborhood categories found to better understand the differences among them. We also intend to better understand the behavior of the category considered good neighborhoods and check whether security policies used to define the behavior of those autonomous systems can serve as a model to others.\nReferences # Orman H (2013) The compleat story of phish.

(1) found that the Neanderthals and the HLA-DPB1*0401 shared Lys at the 69th amino acid and GGPM at the 84th to 87th amino acids of HLA-DPβ. They thus concluded that the Lys-69/GGPM-(84–87) in DPB1*0401 was derived from a Neanderthal introgression.\nThey observed that DPB1*0401 is rare in sub-Saharan Africans (SSA), which is consistent with the claim that the DPB1*0401 was from Neanderthal introgression. However, the DPB1*0402 also carries the Lys-69/GGPM-(84–87), and the frequency of DPB1*0401 and DPB1*0402 in SSA are 5.5 and 18.9%, respectively. Given that the SSA are nearly free from Neanderthal introgression (2), it is less likely that haplotypes from Neanderthal could reach a frequency as high as 24.4% in SSA.\nFurther, we reconstructed a phylogenetic tree for DPB1*0201, DPB1*0202, DPB1*0301, DPB1*0401, and DPB1*0402 haplotypes, along with chimpanzee and high coverage Neanderthal and Denisovan sequences. If the DPB1*0401 were from recent Neanderthal introgression, one would expect that it first coalesced with Neanderthal, instead of other modern human haplotypes (3). However, it was observed that the DPB1*0401 first coalesced with DPB1*0402, then with the two DPB1*02 haplotypes, and then with the Neanderthal and Denisovan sequences. Divergence time between DPB1*0401 and Neanderthal was estimated as 2200 thousand years ago (KYA) (95% confidence interval (CI): 1657.8–2742.2 KYA), which far predates the Neanderthal − modern human divergence time (∼270 KYA). This observation is also inconsistent with the hypothesis that the DPB1*0401 was from Neanderthal introgression. To summarize, the identified Neanderthal introgression at HLA-DPB1*0401 could be an artifact that resulted from ancient population structure.\nREFERENCES # S. Temme, M. Zacharias, J. Neumann, S.

Scheffer Hagaziekenhuis The Hague, Reinier de Graaf Gasthuis Delft, The Hague, The Netherlands\nR. van Mechelen NVVC, Utrecht, The Netherlands\nAnswer # The premature depolarisation following the second QRS complex occurs late in the cardiac cycle (CL = 1000 ms) with a QRS duration of 120 ms followed by a complete compensatory pause (Fig. 1 in the Question article, doi: 10.1007/s12471-015-0655-z). The QRS complex is not preceded by a P wave, excluding an atrial ectopic origin. The amplitude of the R wave is large in leads V2–V4, suggesting an anterior axis deviation of the QRS complex in the precordial leads, which makes an AV nodal origin unlikely in the presence of a left anterior fascicular block during sinus rhythm. Since the QRS width is borderline at around 120 ms, a premature ventricular depolarisation cannot be excluded as origin of the ectopic focus. But what is the most likely explanation for this depolarisation?\nFigure 1 shows the proposed mechanism of activation from a spot in the specific His-Purkinje system where the time of slow anterograde conduction over a diseased left anterior fascicle is equal to the normal conduction time of the impulse, travelling over a longer distance through the posterior fascicle and right bundle. This results in an almost synchronous activation of both right and left ventricle. Already in 1973 [1], electrophysiological investigations were performed to prove this paradoxical phenomenon of premature beats in patients with conduction disease in the left bundle branch (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 figure1 Mechanism of QRS complex by a fascicular ectopic depolarization. The speed of conduction of the impulse is delayed anterogradely over a diseased LAF. A normal speed of conduction occurs through the LPF and RB over a longer distance towards the ventricular myocardium. When both conduction times are equal, the result is a nearly synchronous activation of right and left ventricle. (H common His bundle, LAF left anterior fascicle, LPF left posterior fascicle, RB right bundle)\nFull size image\nThe second part of the question was why does the QRS complex following the first sinus beat in V1–V6 have a different QRS morphology than the other QRS complexes during sinus rhythm? Most likely this beat is a fusion beat, since the QRS complexes in leads V4–V6 are nearly identical with the ectopic focus from the diseased left anterior fascicle.\nReference # Massumi RA, Hilliard G, DeMaria A, Fabregas R, Lindsay AE, Amsterdam E, Mason DT.

FARMACOTHERAPEUTISCHE GROEP EN WERKINGSMECHANISME: HMG-CoA-reductaseremmers in combinatie met andere antilipemica. Ezetimibe remt intestinale absorptie van cholesterol en atorvastatine is een selectieve, competitieve HMG-CoA-reductaseremmer. THERAPEUTISCHE INDICATIES: Aanvullende therapie naast dieet bij volwassenen met primaire (heterozygote familiaire (HeFH) en niet-familiaire) hypercholesterolemie of gemengde hyperlipidemie waar een combinatieproduct aangewezen is; bij patiënten onvoldoende onder controle met statine alleen of die al met een statine en ezetimibe worden behandeld; aanvullende therapie naast dieet bij volwassenen met homozygote familiare hypercholesterolemie (HoFH). CONTRA-INDICATIES Overgevoeligheid voor de ingrediënten; zwangerschap en borstvoeding; bij vruchtbare vrouwen die geen adequate anticonceptiemaatregelen treffen; actieve leverziekte of onverklaarde persisterende verhogingen van serumtransaminasen (\u0026gt;3xULN) BELANGRIJKSTE WAARSCHUWINGEN EN VOORZORGEN BIJ GEBRUIK: Myopathie en rabdomyolyse zijn postmarketing gemeld, meestal bij statines i.c.m. ezetimibe, zeer zelden bij ezetimibe monotherapie of i.c.m. andere middelen met verhoogd risico op rabdomyolyse. HMG-CoA-reductaseremmers incl. atorvastatine hebben invloed op skeletspieren en veroorzaken soms myalgie, myositis en myopathie, soms als (mogelijk levensbedreigende) rabdomyolyse (creatinekinase (CK) \u0026gt;10xULN), myoglobinemie en myoglobinurie, mogelijk leidend tot nierfalen en levensbedreigend). Vóór behandeling voorzichtigheid betrachten bij predisponerende factoren voor rabdomyolyse. Meet het CK vóór start behandeling bij nierfunctiestoornis, hypothyreoïdie, eigen/familiaire voorgeschiedenis van erfelijke spieraandoeningen, voorgeschiedenis van spiertoxiciteit met statine/fibraat, voorgeschiedenis van leverziekte en/of overmatig alcoholgebruik, leeftijd \u0026gt;70 jaar met factoren voor rabdomyolyse, bij risico op toename plasmaconcentraties (interacties, speciale populaties incl. genetische subpopulaties). In dit geval overweeg de voordelen/risico’s van behandeling en klinische controle wordt aanbevolen. Stel behandeling niet in als CK bij baseline-meting significant is verhoogd (\u0026gt;5xULN). CK mag niet worden gemeten na zware lichamelijke inspanning of andere plausibele oorzaak van CK-verhoging, wegens interpretatieproblemen. Als het CK bij baseline \u0026gt;5xULN, meet binnen 5-7 dagen opnieuw om resultaten te bevestigen. Tijdens behandeling: Verzoek patiënten spierpijn, -kramp of -zwakte direct te melden, vooral indien gepaard met malaise of koorts. Meet het CK als deze symptomen optreden tijdens behandeling met ATOZET. Staak behandeling als deze waarden \u0026gt;5xULN). Als spiersymptomen ernstig zijn met dagelijks ongemak, zelfs als CK verhoogd is ≤5xULN, overweeg behandeling te staken . Als symptomen verdwijnen en CK normaliseert, overweeg herstart van ATOZET of start van andere statines in de laagste dosis, met zorgvuldige controle. Staak behandeling met ATOZET indien CK klinisch significant is verhoogd (\u0026gt;10xULN), of bij (vermoeden van) rabdomyolyse. Zeer zelden is immuungemedieerde necrotiserende myopathie gemeld tijdens of na statinebehandeling, incl. atorvastatine (klinisch gekarakteriseerd door proximale spierzwakte en een verhoogd serumcreatinekinase, aanhoudend na staken van de statine). Atorvastatine verhoogt het rabdomyolyserisico bij gelijktijdig gebruik van geneesmiddelen die atorvastatineconcentraties kunnen verhogen, zoals krachtige CYP3A4-remmers of transporteiwitremmers (bijv. ciclosporine, telitromycine, claritromycine, delavirdine, stiripentol, keto/vori/itra/posaconazol en hiv-proteaseremmers). Het myopathierisico kan verhoogd worden door fibrinezuurderivaten (incl. gemfibrozil), boceprevir, erytromycine, niacine, telaprevir, of de combinatie van tipranavir met ritonavir. Alternatieve behandelingen moeten (zonder interactie) worden overwogen. Indien gelijktijdig gebruik van ATOZET nodig is, moeten de voordelen en risico’s zorgvuldig worden afgewogen. Bij geneesmiddelen die plasmaconcentraties atorvastatine verhogen, wordt een lagere maximum dosis ATOZET aanbevolen. Overweeg bij krachtige CYP3A4-remmers tevens een lagere aanvangsdosis en geschikte klinische controle is aanbevolen. Gelijktijdig gebruik met fusidinezuur wordt niet aanbevolen; overweeg tijdelijk staken van ATOZET tijdens gebruik van fusidinezuur. In gecontroleerde onderzoeken naar co-administratie van ezetimibe met atorvastatine, zijn opeenvolgende verhogingen van transaminasen (≥3x ULN) waargenomen. Leverfunctiecontrole wordt aanbevolen vóór start van behandeling en regelmatig daarna, en ook bij ontwikkeling van tekenen van leverbeschadiging. Als serumtransaminasespiegels stijgen, moeten controles worden uitgevoerd totdat afwijkingen zijn verdwenen; bij aanhoudende stijging tot 3xULN wordt dosisverlaging/staken van ATOZET aanbevolen. ATOZET met voorzichtigheid toepassen bij patiënten die aanzienlijke hoeveelheden alcohol consumeren en/of leverziektehistorie hebben. Vanwege het onbekende effect van verhoogde blootstelling aan ezetimibe bij een matige of ernstige leverinsufficiëntie, wordt ATOZET hierbij niet aanbevolen. De veiligheid en werkzaamheid van ezetimibe met fibraten zijn niet vastgesteld; gelijktijdige toediening wordt niet aanbevolen. Betracht voorzichtigheid bij co-administratie van ATOZET met ciclosporine; controleer ciclosporineconcentraties. Controleer INR bij gebruik van warfarine, andere coumarine-anticoagulantia of fluindion. In een post-hoc-analyse van subtypes van beroerte zonder coronaire hartziekte maar met recent doorgemaakte beroerte of TIA was er een hogere incidentie van hersenbloedingen bij patiënten die waren gestart met 80 mg atorvastatine vergeleken met placebo. Een verhoogd risico werd vooral gezien bij patiënten die eerder een hemorragische beroerte of lacunair infarct hadden gehad. Bij eerder doorgemaakte hemorragische beroerte of lacunair infarct is risico-batenbalans van 80 mg atorvastatine onduidelijk, en moet het potentiële risico op hersenbloeding worden afgewogen alvorens de behandeling te beginnen. Uitzonderlijke gevallen van interstitiële longziekte zijn gemeld bij sommige statines, vooral bij langdurige behandeling (kenmerken zijn o.a. dyspneu, niet-productieve hoest en afname algehele gezondheid (vermoeidheid, gewichtsverlies, koorts)). Bij vermoeden van interstitiële longziekte moet de statine worden gestaakt. Er zijn aanwijzingen dat statines bloedglucose verhogen en bij sommige patiënten met hoog risico op toekomstige diabetes een mate van hyperglykemie kunnen veroorzaken, die formele diabeteszorg vereist. Dit risico weegt minder zwaar dan verlaging van het vasculaire risico en moet geen reden zijn om de statine te stoppen. Controleer patiënten met dit risico (nuchter glucose 5,6 tot 6,9 mmol/l, BMI \u0026gt; 30 kg/m2, verhoogde triglyceriden, hypertensie) klinisch en biochemisch volgens de landelijke richtlijnen.

DATUM SPC: Oktober 2014.\nVerkorte productinformatie Eliquis 2,5 en 5 mg filmomhulde tabletten. ▼ Dit geneesmiddel is onderworpen aan aanvullende monitoring. Samenstelling: elke filmomhulde tablet bevat 2,5 mg of 5 mg apixaban. Farmacotherapeutische categorie: Direct factor Xa inhibitors ATCcode: B01AF02. Indicaties 2,5 mg: Preventie van veneuze trombo-embolische voorvallen (VTE) bij volwassen patiënten die een electieve heup- of kniev- ervangingsoperatie hebben ondergaan. Indicaties 2,5 en 5 mg: Preventie van beroerte en systemische embolie bij volwassen patiënten met niet-val- vulair atriumfibrilleren (nvAF), met een of meer risicofactoren, zoals een eerdere beroerte of transiënte ischemische aanval (TIA); leeftijd ≥ 75 jaar; hypertensie; diabetes mellitus; symptomatisch hartfalen (NYHA klasse ≥ II). Behandeling van diepveneuze trombose (DVT) en pulmonaire embolie (PE) en preventie van herhaalde DVT en PE bij volwassenen (zie rubriek 4.4 voor hemodynamisch instabiele PE patiënten). Dosering en toediening Preventie van VTE (VTEp): electieve heup- of knievervangingsoperatie: De aanbevolen dosis Eliquis is tweemaal daags 2,5 mg, oraal in te nemen. De aanvangsdosis dient 12 tot 24 uur na de operatie te worden ingenomen. Artsen kunnen de mogelijke voordelen van eerdere antistolling voor VTE profylaxe en het postoperatieve bloedingsrisico in overweging nemen bij het besluit inzake toediening binnen dit tijdsinterval. De aanbevolen duur van de behandeling is 32 tot 38 dagen bij heupvervanging en 10 tot 14 dagen bij knievervanging. Preventie van beroerte en systemische embolie bij volwassen patiënten met niet-valvulair atriumfibrilleren (nvAF): De aanbevolen dosis van Eliquis is tweemaal daags 5 mg oraal. Bij patiënten met nvAF en minstens twee van de volgende eigenschappen: leeftijd ≥ 80 jaar, lichaamsgewicht ≤ 60 kg, of serumcreatinine ≥ 1,5 mg/dl (133 micromol/l) is de aanbevolen dosis van Eliquis tweemaal daags 2,5 mg oraal. Behandeling van DVT, behandeling van PE en preventie van herhaalde DVT en PE (VTEt): De aanbevolen dosis van Eliquis voor de behandeling van acute DVT en behandeling van PE is tweemaal daags 10 mg oraal genomen gedurende de eerste 7 dagen, gevolgd door tweemaal daags 5 mg oraal genomen. Zoals volgens de beschikbare medische richtlijnen dient een korte behandelduur (minstens 3 maanden) gebaseerd te zijn op transciënte risicofactoren (bijvoorbeeld operatie, trauma, immobilisatie). De aanbevolen dosis van Eliquis voor de preventie van herhaalde DVT en PE is tweemaal daags 2,5 mg oraal genomen. Als preventie van herhaalde DVT is geïndi- ceerd, dient met tweemaal daags 2,5 mg te worden gestart na het afronden van de 6 maanden behandeling met Eliquis 5 mg tweemaal daags of met een andere anticoagulans, zoals hieronder weergegeven: - Behandeling van DVT of PE: doseringsschema 10 mg tweemaal daags gedurende de eerste 7 dagen (maximale dagelijkse dosering 20 mg) gevolgd door 5 mg tweemaal daags; - Preventie van herhaalde DVT en/of PE na afronden van 6 maanden behandeling van DVT of PE: doseringsschema 2,5 mg tweemaal daags (maximale dagelijkse dosering 5 mg). De duur van de totale be- handeling dient per individu te worden bepaald na zorgvuldig afwegen van het behandelvoordeel tegen het risico op bloedingen. Contra-indicaties: overgevoeligheid voor het werkzame bestanddeel of voor één van de hulpstoffen. Klinisch significante actieve bloedingen. Leverziekte die gepaard gaat met coagulopathie en een klinisch relevant bloedingsrisico. Laesie of aandoening met een verhoogd risico op ernstige bloedingen zoals huidige of recente gastro-intestinale ulceratie, aanwezigheid van maligne neoplasmata met een hoog risico op bloedingen, recent letsel aan hersenen of ruggenmerg, recente operatie aan hersenen, ruggenmerg of ogen, recente intracraniale bloeding, aanwezigheid van of verdenking van oesofageale varices, arterioveneuze malformaties, vasculaire aneurysma’s of ernstige vasculaire afwijkingen in de hersenen of in het ruggenmerg. Gelijktijdige behandeling met andere antistollingsmiddelen (ongefractioneerde heparine, laag moleculair gewicht heparine, heparinederivaten, orale antistolling- smiddelen), behalve in het specifieke geval van veranderen van anticoagulans of indien ongefractioneerde heparine bij een centraal veneuze of ar- teriële katheter. Patiënten met zeldzame erfelijke problemen met galactose-intolerantie, Lapp-lactasedeficiëntie of glucose-galactosemalabsorptie dienen dit geneesmiddel niet te gebruiken. Waarschuwingen en voorzorgsmaatregelen: Eliquis-patiënten dienen nauwlettend te worden gecon- troleerd op tekenen van bloedingen. Het wordt aangeraden het middel met voorzichtigheid te gebruiken bij aandoeningen met een verhoogd risico op bloeding. Toediening dient te worden stopgezet als ernstige bloeding optreedt. Het gelijktijdig gebruik van Eliquis met plaatjesaggregatieremmers verhoogt het risico op bloedingen. Voorzichtigheid moet worden betracht als patiënten gelijktijdig behandeld worden met NSAID’s, waaronder acetyl- salicylzuur. De veiligheid en werkzaamheid van Eliquis zijn niet onderzocht bij patiënten met een prothetische hartklep, met of zonder atriumfibriller- en. Het gebruik van Eliquis wordt daarom niet aanbevolen onder deze omstandigheden. Behandeling met Eliquis dient minstens 48 uur gestaakt te worden voorafgaand aan een electieve operatie of invasieve procedures met een matig of hoog bloedingsrisico en 24 uur in het geval van een laag bloedingsrisico. Behandeling met apixaban dient zo snel mogelijk opnieuw te worden gestart na de invasieve procedure of operatieve interventie (zodra de klinische situatie dit toestaat en adequate hemostase bereikt is). Wanneer neuraxiale anesthesie of spinale/epidurale punctie wordt toege- past, lopen patiënten die ter preventie van trombo-embolische complicaties met antitrombotica worden behandeld, het risico op een epiduraal of spinaal hematoom dat kan resulteren in langdurige of permanente paralyse. Eliquis wordt niet aanbevolen als een alternatief voor ongefractioneerde heparines bij patiënten met pulmonaire embolie die hemodynamisch instabiel zijn of die trombolyse of pulmonale embolectomie ondergaan, omdat de veiligheid en werkzaamheid van apixaban niet zijn vastgesteld in deze klinische situaties. De werkzaamheid en veiligheid van apixaban in de be- handeling van DVT, behandeling van PE en de preventie van herhaalde DVT en PE (VTEt) bij patiënten met actieve kanker zijn niet vastgesteld. Bep- erkte klinische gegevens bij patiënten met ernstige nierinsufficiëntie (creatinineklaring 15 –29 ml/min) toont aan dat apixabanplasmaconcentraties zijn verhoogd bij deze patiënten en dit kan leiden tot een verhoogd bloedingsrisico. Voor de preventie van VTE bij electieve knie- of heupvervanging- soperatie (VTEp), voor de behandeling van DVT, behandeling van PE en preventie van herhaalde DVT en PE (VTEt), dient apixaban met voorzichtigheid te worden gebruikt bij patiënten met ernstige nierinsufficiëntie (creatinineklaring 15-29 ml/min) (zie rubriek 4.2 en 5.2). Voor de preventie van bero- erte en systemische embolie bij patiënten met NVAF dienen patiënten met ernstige nierinsufficiëntie (creatinineklaring 15-29 ml/min) en patiënten met serumcreatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dl (133 micromol/l), in combinatie met een leeftijd ≥ 80 jaar of een lichaamsgewicht ≤ 60 kg, ook de lagere dosis apixaban 2,5 mg tweemaal daags te krijgen (zie rubriek 4.2). Omdat er geen klinische ervaring is bij patiënten met een creatinineklaring \u0026lt; 15 ml/min of bij patiënten die dialyse ondergaan, wordt apixaban niet aangeraden bij deze patiënten (zie rubrieken 4.2 en 5.2). Een laag lichaamsgewicht (\u0026lt; 60 kg) kan het risico op bloedingen doen toenemen. Eliquis is gecontra-indiceerd bij patiënten met leverziekte die gepaard gaat met coagulopathie en een klinisch relevant bloedingsrisico. Het middel wordt niet aangeraden bij patiënten met ernstige leverinsufficiëntie. Het dient met voorzichtigheid te worden gebruikt bij patiënten met lichte of matige leverinsufficiëntie (Child Pugh A of B) en bij patiënten met verhoogde leverenzymen ALAT/ASAT \u0026gt;2 x ULN of totaal bilirubine ≥1,5 x ULN. Voordat de behandeling met Eliquis wordt gestart, dient een leverfunctietest te worden uitgevoerd. Bij pa- tiënten die gelijktijdige systemische behandeling met sterke inductoren van zowel CYP3A4 als P-gp krijgen, zijn de volgende aanbevelingen van toe- passing: - voor de preventie van VTE bij electieve heup of knievervangingsoperatie, voor de preventie van beroerte en systemische embolie bij patiënt- en met NVAF en voor de preventie van herhaalde DVT en PE dient apixaban met voorzichtigheid te worden gebruikt; - voor de behandeling van DVT en PE dient apixaban niet te worden gebruikt omdat de werkzaamheid verminderd kan zijn. Apixaban wordt niet aangeraden tijdens zwangerschap of borstvoeding. Bijwerkingen: Vaak voorkomende bijwerkingen waren bloedingen, contusie, epistaxis en hematoom (zie tabel 2 van de SPC voor het bijwerkingenprofiel en frequenties per indicatie). Het gebruik van Eliquis kan gepaard gaan met een verhoogd risico op occulte of met het blote oog zichtbare bloedingen vanuit een weefsel of orgaan, wat kan resulteren in posthemorragische anemie.

My thesis, carried out under the supervision of Erwin Chargaff, dealt with the stereochemistry of an enzymatic reaction, the oxidation of isomers of inositol to mono- or diketones by Acetobacter suboxydans (2). I therefore chose for my independent research the investigation of the pathway of myo-inositol degradation that enables Klebsiella aerogenes (then called Aerobacter aerogenes) to use this cyclitol as the sole source of carbon and energy. These studies led many years later to the identification of a series of enzymatic reactions responsible for the degradation of myo-inositol to CO2 and the glycolytic intermediates dihydroxyacetone phosphate and acetyl-CoA (3). I was intrigued by the observation that the ability to degrade inositol was not constitutive but adaptive in that the cells acquired it after exposure to inositol (4). I therefore decided, in collaboration with a visitor from Japan, Dr. Daizo Ushiba, to use amino acid- and purine-requiring mutants to investigate whether this adaptation required the synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids (1). Our results supported the view that protein synthesis played a role in this adaptation; however, at about the same time Jacques Monod at the Pasteur Institute similarly found that the induced synthesis of β-galactosidase by Escherichia coli did not occur in the absence of a required amino acid (5) and subsequently proved that induction resulted in the synthesis de novo of this enzyme (6). Our results, particularly since the enzymes responsible for the degradation of myo-inositol had not yet been discovered, did not significantly contribute to the elucidation of the problem of induced enzyme synthesis.\nHowever, the mutants we had isolated for this investigation proved to have unexpected properties. One mutant had a specific requirement for guanine and was found to excrete xanthosine (7), suggesting that xanthosine-5-P was an intermediate in the conversion of IMP to GMP. Further study of the interconversions of purine nucleotides resulted in the discovery of the enzymes responsible for this conversion (8, 9) as well as of GMP reductase, which catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of GMP to IMP (10). In addition, our studies revealed that the nitrogen 1-carbon 2 portion of the purine ring was the precursor of the nitrogen 1-carbon 2 portion of the imidazole ring of histidine and demonstrated that the synthesis of the histidine precursor imidazoleglycerol phosphate from ATP, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate, and glutamine resulted in the formation of the nucleotide of aminoimidazole carboxamide, which could be converted to IMP (the precursor of AMP and GMP (11)). The resulting cyclic network responsible for the synthesis of histidine and the interconversion of purine nucleotides was shown to be regulated by feedback inhibition of the critical enzymes by AMP, GMP, and histidine (12).\nThis paper is available on line at http://www.jbc.org 22557 This is an Open Access article under the CC BY license.\nThe properties of another mutant that had been isolated for our study of adaptation to inositol were also very interesting. This mutant required 30 times as much histidine for full growth when inositol rather than glucose served as the major source of carbon (1). We discovered that K. aerogenes has the ability to produce a series of four enzymes capable of converting histidine to glutamate, ammonia, and formamide. These enzymes allow histidine to serve as the source of carbon and nitrogen for the growth of this organism. We found that the presence of glucose, but not of inositol, in the growth medium prevents the synthesis of these enzymes (13, 14). In this manner glucose allows histidine, and in the case of E. coli, tryptophan, to fulfill its specific role in the synthesis of protein rather than to serve as a source of energy and carbon, which are more effectively produced by the degradation of glucose. This consideration led me to propose the name “catabolite repression” for this effect of glucose (15). According to this view, the high intracellular concentration of catabolites derived from glucose prevents the synthesis of enzymes whose activities would result in the formation of the same catabolites at a rate lower than that from other sources of carbon and energy.\nWe were subsequently able to identify a site closely linked to the promoter of the lac operon as the site responsible for the susceptibility of β-galactosidase to catabolite repression and to show that mutations in the promoter could make lac expression resistant to catabolite repression (16, 17). The site closely linked to the promoter was later identified as the binding site for CAP-cyclic AMP, which is required for the transcription of this operon.\nOur studies on the genetics of the hut (histidine utilization) system in Salmonella enterica (serovar typhimurium) and in K. aerogenes showed that the genes for the four enzymes required for histidine degradation and a gene coding for a repressor capable of blocking the transcription of these genes are organized as two linked operons. The repressor is inactivated by urocanate, the product of histidase, the enzyme catalyzing the first step of the pathway. The observation that the gene coding for the repressor is a member of one of these operons was the first example of autogenous regulation of gene expression (these studies are reviewed in Ref. 18).\nEven more important for the later work of my laboratory was the observation that the ability of glucose to prevent the synthesis of the enzymes required by K. aerogenes to degrade histidine could apparently be overcome by growing the cells in a medium containing glucose as the source of carbon and histidine as the sole source of nitrogen (19). This observation resulted in the discovery of a previously unknown global regulatory system responding to the availability of ammonia, the preferred nitrogen source of bacteria and fungi. We made this discovery when we examined the ability of a mutant of K. aerogenes requiring cyclic AMP to grow in media in which histidine either served as the sole source of carbon or served as the sole source of nitrogen with glucose as the source of carbon (20). We found that cyclic AMP, known to be essential for the synthesis of enzymes subject to catabolite repression, was required when histidine served as the source of carbon but not when it served as the source of nitrogen. Apparently in the latter condition an activator other than CAP-cyclic AMP was able to activate the expression of the hut operons. We also found that not only the expression of the hut genes but also the expression of the put genes coding for the enzyme and permease required for the utilization of proline (20) and the expression of glnA, the structural gene for glutamine synthetase, could be activated by substituting a non-preferred source of nitrogen for ammonia (20, 21).\nAll cellular nitrogen is derived either from the amino nitrogen of glutamate or the amide nitrogen of glutamine. Our discovery showed that the presence of ammonia, the preferred source of nitrogen, prevents the expression of genes coding for the enzymes able to produce the nitrogen required for the synthesis of glutamate and glutamine from other, non-preferred sources of nitrogen. The exploration of this nitrogen regulation has been the major subject of the studies of my laboratory for the last 30 years.\nOur studies of this problem in enteric bacteria led to the discovery of the previously unknown \\(\\sigma\\) factor, \\(\\sigma^{54}\\) , the discovery that promoters using \\(\\sigma^{54}\\) -RNA polymerase require activation by an activator binding to sites far from the promoter, an interaction that requires bending of the intervening DNA, and the discovery of two-component signal transduction. These studies are reviewed in Refs. 22 and 23.\nWe also began to study the problem of nitrogen regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (24). We found that the activation of the expression of nitrogen-regulated genes requires one of two activators that recognize the nucleotide sequence 5′-GATAAG-3′ of an enhancer located upstream of the genes subject to this regulation. The activator Gln3p in the presence of glutamine binds to the product of the URE2 gene and is thereby prevented from entering the nucleus to bind to the enhancer. These studies are reviewed in Ref. 25.\nMy scientific career reflects an aspect of the progress of microbial biochemistry in the last 50 years. From the study of glycolysis to the identification of the metabolic pathways responsible for the synthesis of the building blocks of proteins and nucleic acids to the elucidation of the genetics and molecular biology of the regulation of gene expression.\nAcknowledgments # I thank Hilda Harris-Ransom for the preparation of the manuscript.\nReferences # D.

Five years later, PSS remains the sole journal devoted to patient safety issues in surgery. The conception of the Journal’s mission originated in the summer of 2006 with a group of surgeon colleagues brain-storming about the meaning of the dogma that “good judgment comes from experience which comes from poor judgment”. During our routine weekly morbidity and mortality conferences in Denver and Zurich, we regularly unraveled severe complications generated by younger colleagues on their “learning curve”. Unfortunately, the patient is the one who eventually pays the price for the individual surgeon’s experience. We speculated about new options for sharing root causes of preventable incidents and complications, in order to avoid similar events to re-occur in a different patient in a different hospital. This fruitful debate led to the brainchild of creating a new international “forum” for exchanging case scenarios of specific surgical complications. This forum should be easily accessible, and include discussion of root causes, preventability, and action items needed for resolution and prevention of the future re-occurrence of identical, or similar, adverse events. Our debate also scrutinized the tendency of most standard print journals to publish positive data exclusively, with little room for negative results and reports on surgical failures and poor patient outcomes [2]. In a united consensus, we reasoned that the best option for creating a new forum of unrestricted reporting and debate on quality of care issues in the perioperative setting would be to start our own journal. The enthusiasm of the successive weeks let to the design of the mission statement for PSS (http://www.pssjournal.com/about). We further brain-stormed about the most suitable and representative project title for the new journal, and came up with some of the following tentative suggestions:\n\u0026ldquo;Journal of Poor Judgment in Surgical Decision-Making” \u0026ldquo;Journal of Surgical Errors and Preventable Complications” \u0026ldquo;Journal of Surgical Complications” \u0026ldquo;Journal of Preventable Complications and Patient Safety” Ultimately, we decided to omit any negative aspect in the title, related to terms such as “errors” and “complications”, and instead to focus on an exclusively positive message in the final title, Patient Safety in Surgery[1]. With strong support from the publisher, BioMedCentral (BMC), the new journal was successfully launched on November 7, 2007, accompanied by the first two peer-reviewed articles.\nThe mission # As outlined on the PSS homepage (http://www.pssjournal.com), the Journal’s mission is to increase the safety and quality of care for patients undergoing surgical procedures in all fields of surgery. The Journal was designed to complement the more than 200 traditional surgical journals by filling an essential void, through providing a forum for discussion, analysis, and work-up of system and process failures, technical complications, medical errors, and other adverse events in the management of surgical patients in the perioperative setting. This scientific forum was created to lower the threshold for reporting adverse events in all fields of surgery, with the long-term goal of increasing the safety and quality of care for patients undergoing surgical procedures. Ultimately, health care providers from around the world need to be able to safely and openly report anything that does not go well for their patients. As surgeons, we are the only group of people on earth whom other humans give formal consent to render them unconscious and open their bodies with a knife. Thus, we have the highest onus to leave no stone unturned in our quest to do the “right thing” for our patients. We strongly consider public reporting of medical errors and surgical complications an ethical responsibility of our profession. Therefore, we will continue to strive to offer PSS as a vehicle of transparency, trust, and credibility for the public who has a right to know the truth about the quality and safety of surgical care provided around the globe.\nThe first 5 years: a spectacular start # During the first 5 years, PSS had a spectacular beginning, a notion which is supported by the following actual statistics:\nThe readers’ access to papers published on the PSS website (http://www.pssjournal.com) has increased from less than 2,000 hits in 2007, to up to 16,000 accesses per month in 2012 (Figure 1). Figure 1 figure1 Article accesses to Patient Safety in Surgery. The graph shows the growing number of accesses to PSS articles, from the time of the Journal’s launch in November 2007, until June 2012. The data reflect access statistics to the PSS webpage exclusively, and do not include additional sources of access, including PubMed and other portals and article repositories.\nFull size image\nThe top-25 most accessed articles have been viewed through the PSS website more than 500,000 times until present (http://www.pssjournal.com/mostviewed/alltime). The Journal is supported by an internationally renowned editorial board of 59 editors from 15 different countries (http://www.pssjournal.com/edboard), and is read online in more than 180 countries around the world (Figure 2). Figure 2 figure2 Global readership of Patient Safety in Surgery. All countries with previous access to articles published in PSS are marked in blue background. The few unmarked countries do not have a history of access to the Journal. These selected states include Greenland, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and some countries in West Africa and Central Africa.\nFull size image\nPSS has an “unofficial” impact factor of 1.19 (http://www.pssjournal.com). This impact factor is calculated by the identical formula as for the Journal Citation Reports (JCR®) and thus reflects a “real” number for the journal’s impact factor, albeit not (yet) officially sanctioned by Thomson Reuters [3]. Of all manuscripts published in PSS from 2010–2011, the most frequently cited article has been cited 15 times in other journals [4], and the most accessed paper has been viewed through the Journal’s webpage more than 16,000 times [5]. Overall, more than 140 articles have been published in PSS until present, with an average rejection rate of 20%. The Journal continues to publish two editorials per calendar year which address controversial topics in the field (/http://www.pssjournal.com/content?articleTypes=Editorial). The average time from manuscript submission to a first editorial decision is currently one month (30 days), and the time to a final decision lies around two months from initial submission (40–80 days). The “key” to a successful fast-track management of submitted manuscript lies in the timely appointment of suitable referees, and the reliance on their timely acceptance and commitment to returning their reviews within 14 days. Overall, an average of 88% of all invited referees accept their assignment within less than 5 days from manuscript submission, a statistic which speaks for the quality of the initial reviewer selection by the managing editors (Figure 3).\nFigure 3 figure3 Reviewer invitation time (upper panel) and invite acceptance rate (lower panel) in 2011. The mean time to assign two individual referees to evaluate a submitted manuscript has been drastically reduced in 2011, from originally more than 40 days, to currently less than 5 days (from day of submission). Furthermore, an average of 88% of all invited reviewers accepted their assignment in 2011. This efficient recruitment of qualified referees allows for the fast-track management of submitted manuscripts, and guarantees short turn-around times until a first editorial decision is made.`\nFull size image A meta-analysis of post-publication surveys from authors who have previously published in the Journal reveals the following primary reasons for submitting their work to PSS:\n(1) Journal scope / Good prior experience (2) Journal reputation and profile (3) Fast peer review / Speed of publication Overall, within just 5 years of the initial launch, PSS has been able to solidify its early reputation as an internationally respected journal in the important field of patient safety in the perioperative setting.\nChallenges and road bumps # The design and implementation of PSS as a new journal in its field was accompanied by multiple challenges and hurdles. As an anecdotal example, many friends and colleagues (as well as the publisher’s legal advisers!) discouraged the founding editors from introducing an article category on “case reports”. The underlying argument was that “only a fool will agree to publish a case report on preventable complications which lead to poor patient outcomes”. This notion is based on the rationale that such a document would provide a written testimony (and admission of guilt) which could be used in court against the individual medical practitioner in case of a malpractice claim or lawsuit. The ultimate resolution consisted of introducing a mandatory request for submitting authors to provide a written consent from patients or their legal guardians for any manuscript which provides information on specific identifiable individual patient scenarios (http://www.pssjournal.com/authors/instructions).\nStrikingly, we were astonished by the unexpected high submission rate of case reports on surgical complications, preventable sentinel events, and “never events”, starting from the first weeks of the journal’s launch [6, 7], until the present day [8, 9]. This impressive fact supports the notion that health care providers all over the globe appear to strive to publicly report, analyze, and discuss root causes and preventive measures of adverse events which lead to unnecessary patient harm, in order to provide more transparency to other health care providers, and to the public. Indeed, until present, PSS published a total of 50 case reports on individual complications and medical errors, and the manuscript submissions in the “case report” category keep coming in.\nBeyond a doubt, the main barrier which deters authors from submitting their work to PSS (and for that matter to open access journals in general) is represented by the extremely high publication fees. For journals published by BMC, these so-called “article processing charges” (APCs) – which have to be carried by the author – range from $1,600 to $1,900 per article (http://www.biomedcentral.com/about/apcfaq). A recent commentary published in Science discussed the findings of a large-scale survey on the perceived role of open access online journals among 50,000 researchers [10]. While 89% of all respondents expressed their support for open access publishing in general, they admitted to publish only about 10% of their own research in open access journals [10]. The two main reasons stated for the poor submission rate were high publication fees (40%) and the apparent lack of high-quality open access journals in the respondents’ field of interest (30%) [10].\nAnd here lies the conundrum of open access publishing: Why would a hypothetical author submit high-quality research to an open access journal with low reputation and no (or low) impact factor, which comes at a price of up to $2,000 publication costs, instead of targeting a prestigious high-impact print journal, free of charge? The answer is intuitive.\nIncentives to publish in PSS # PSS has seen a tremendous start in its first 5 years, and we have successfully resolved some of the initial “childhood diseases” of any new journal. In order to overcome the financial impediment for submission of high-quality articles imposed by the high processing fees, we were recently able to obtain independent grant support for coverage of the APC fees for 30 articles submitted by outside researchers. Pre-submission inquiries for qualification of a waiver for processing fees should be submitted to the editorial board (philip.stahel@dhha.org). Requests will be screened by the managing editors based on objective metrics related to the manuscript’s scientific quality. An anecdotal example of a manuscript which was actively commissioned for PSS, with the authors’ APC fees being waived through extramural grant support, shows that this paper is currently ranked as the #1 most viewed article in the Journal of all times, with more than 23,000 accesses until present [11]. This example supports the argument that high-quality submissions are difficult to commission in presence of the financial “APC barrier”.\nUndoubtedly, the open access modality of publishing in PSS provides unprecedented advantages compared to standard print journals. The elimination of financial barriers related to individual or institutional journal subscriptions allows for global and unrestricted free access to all published articles. This proactive modality likely represents the underlying reason for a new journal, such as PSS, being read in more than 180 countries around the world (Figure 2). In addition, submitting authors from developing countries can request a formal APC waiver by the publisher, which is usually granted within a few days of the inquiry.\nThe following aspects provide some irrefutable incentives for publishing in PSS:\nAll articles published in PSS are free to read, copy, distribute, and re-publish in parts or in entirety (with attribution of the original source). Authors retain the full unrestricted copyright on the entire article. This allows for replicating data and figures in future publications (e.g. review articles or book chapters) without the need for requesting a formal copyright release by the publisher, as long as the original source is adequately cited. There is no limit to the length of an individual article, including the number of tables and figures. There are no extra charges for publishing an unrestricted amount of high-quality color figures. Movie clips can be embedded for instructional purposes at no extra cost, through embedded links in the manuscript (see example: [12]). The fast-track publication process allows for short turn-around times of submitted manuscripts and publication within about 2 months of initial submission. All articles are cited in PubMed within less than one week of provisional publication. All articles published in PSS are archived in public repositories, including PubMed Central, in compliance with the NIH Public Access Policy. The next 5-year vision # The first international editorial board meeting for PSS took place on October 3, 2012, at the Clinical Congress of the American College of Surgeons (ACS) in Chicago, IL. During this meeting, we discussed current challenges and outlined the future vision for the Journal in the next 5 years. One priority is to take PSS from its first unofficial impact factor of 1.19 to an official impact factor in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR®). This goal precludes the prospect of being tracked by Thomson Reuters for an official impact factor. Indeed, selected online open access journals have accomplished the task of “squaring the circle” by achieving high impact factors which are competitive with standard print journals in their respective field. Impressively, one representative open access journal from the “Public Library of Science”, PLoS Biology, has reached an impact factor of 11.45, which ranks the journal #1 in the JCR® category of ‘Biology’ in 2011. Additional examples of selected open access online journals with noteworthy impact factors are listed below (year of launch and current impact factor in parentheses):\nJournal of Hematology \u0026amp; Oncology (2008; IF 3.99) PLoS ONE (2006; IF 4.09) Molecular Neurodegeneration (2006; IF 4.28) Journal of Neuroinflammation (2004; IF 3.83) Retrovirology (2004; IF 6.47) BMC Biology (2003; IF 5.75) PLoS Biology (2003; IF 11.45) Genome Biology (2000; IF 9.04) Breast Cancer Research (1999; IF 5.25) These selected open access journals serve as pioneer role models with regard to the gradual transition from the “classic” entity of print publication to the future model of open access publishing of high quality science in high impact online journals. Clearly, the impact factor alone does not guarantee the quality of submitted papers, but rather represents a surrogate marker for the scientific renown of a journal in the international community. However, in this day and age of restricted grant funding opportunities, a journal with a (high) impact factor is more likely to be targeted by better quality submissions.\nAnother important and challenging goal for the next 5 years includes the plan to inaugurate an “International Society for Patient Safety in Surgery”. This new society will further enhance the current global patient safety initiative aimed at increasing transparency about the quality of medical care to the public, who remains the ultimate stakeholder [13]. The obligation for us, as physicians and surgeons, lies in sustaining our public credibility by full and honest disclosure and reporting of medical errors and surgical complications [14].\nUltimately, PSS strives to position itself as a landmark journal in the field of patient safety in the perioperative setting, with a global renown for publishing high-quality science in this important field. There is a lot of work ahead of us. We would like to thank our readership, submitting authors, peer reviewers, and our editorial board for their loyalty in the past 5 years, and for their continuing support of the journal’s mission in the future.\nReferences # Stahel PF, Clavien PA, Hahnloser D, Smith WR: A new journal devoted to patient safety in surgery: the time is now!.

In recent years, the popularity of this food goes upward to foreign countries after CNN’s polling in 2011, and 2017 placed rendang at the first number of the most delicious food in the world. Along this time, rendang is often associated with the culture of Malay and Minangkabau. Nevertheless, this research tries to trace the historicity of rendang and also the possibility of foreign culinary influences which shapes this Minangkabau’s food heritage. By employing the historical method supported with the reading of various primary sources, this article traces the trail of rendang and resulted fact findings related to foreign culinary influences in West Sumatra and also its development in becoming an Indonesian national food.\nIntroduction # There are so many ethnic foods in the Indonesian culinary sphere. Of the many, rendang can be said to be an iconic one in the collective tastes of the Indonesians and has even become a part of the national identity, besides it also being associated with the Minangkabau culture of West Sumatra. It can be seen from how rendang is always presented in typical Minangkabau restaurants in every city in Indonesia, always presented as one of the special dishes on every Lebaran (Islamic holy day), and is one of the common domestic menus in Indonesian households. In essence, this Minangkabau specialty food is liked by all social levels and ethnic groups in Indonesia.\nThe image of rendang as an ethnic and domestic food then increased to the global level after CNN Go released a poll titled “World’s 50 Most Delicious Foods” in 2011. The world’s attention then was turned to this black meat preserved food. The results of the poll put rendang in the top-notch position as the most delicious food in the world. This has become a kind of “victory” for Indonesia in dealing with Malaysia, considering that this neighbor country once claimed rendang as part of its national food. In 2017, based on 35,000 votes on social media, out of fifty delicious foods in the world, CNN Travel in the “World’s 50 Best Foods” poll, again put rendang in the first place as the world’s most delicious food (Fig. 1) [1].\nFig. 1 figure1 Screenshot of rendang at 1st rank of 2017 CNN Travel poll “World’s 50 Best Foods” [1]. This poll is not merely considered by many Indonesians as proof of rendang as the most delicious food. However, this is more often used by the government and various culinary communities to claim that rendang belongs to Indonesia (not Malaysia). Many do not realize that the context of this claim makes rendang no longer the most delicious food. Rendang has shifted its meaning to being loaded with political content\nFull size image The rating as the most delicious food in the world itself is more on representing the tastes of foreigners in assessing the long-lasting and “crunchy” rendang; different generally with processed meat that is chewy or tough. Rendang is considered suitable not only as an official dinner, but also as a provision for travelers who need preserved food for weekly to monthly periods. Cooking rendang can also be interpreted as a surefire strategy to prevent meat from decay so that it can be eaten anytime and taken anywhere. The drying process for it to be durable is long and requires patience. But the fruit of patience can be felt from how important, efficient, and economical the results of this meat preservation process are.\nAlong with the growing popularity of rendang in the world, it also appeared in several publications which aimed to strengthen the image of rendang not only as a Minangkabau identity, but also as the nation’s cultural heritage. The effort was seen from three works of rendang by Reno Andam Suri [2,3,4], namely The Story of Rendang, Rendang Traveler: Menyingkap Bertuahnya Rendang Minang (Rendang Traveler: Uncovering the Sorcerer’s Rendang Minang), and Rendang: Minang Legacy to the World. This publication is needed to disseminate knowledge on the tradition and philosophy behind rendang to the people of Indonesia and abroad. This is certainly a kind of cultural strategy to legitimize rendang as well as dismiss the claims against rendang as carried out by Indonesia’s neighboring country in recent years. An Indonesian senior actress that has Minangkabau descent, Jajang C. Noer, for example, expressed her surprise when Indonesia and Malaysia claimed rendang to themselves [5]. She emphasized in a humorous tone that rendang did not belong to Indonesia or Malaysia, but rather from Padang (West Sumatra’s capital city). This claim has made tension to Indonesian bilateral relations with Malaysia several times [5, 6], whereas historically, both countries actually were allied brothers [7]. Indonesian culinary expert, late Bondan Winarno [8], once said that rendang should be understood as a “pusaka bersama” (shared heritage) between Indonesia and Malaysia.\nAlthough it has been attached as a unique part of West Sumatra and Malay cuisine, the origin of rendang itself has not been explored in depth. In terms of historical substance, the “origin” word itself does not only refer to the rendang image that has been synonymous with “Minangkabau culture” and “Malay culture”, but also the possibility of foreign influence that shape rendang culture itself. This possibility certainly needs to be explored considering that in the past, Indonesia culinary culture cannot be separated from the touch of foreign culinary influences.\nSome historians from West Sumatra seem to be still confused in investigating the rendang’s origin. That, for example, can be read from the opinions contained in the series of “Jelajah Kuliner Nusantara” (exploring Archipelago culinary) in the national newspaper Kompas 1 September 2013, Rendang dan Martabat Minang (rendang and Minangkabau’s dignity) [9].\nFirst, there is historian Muhammad Nur who assumed that a meat food like rendang have been mentioned in oral history since the ancient centuries (between the fourth and tenth centuries). As for the written record of processed meat, he said it only appeared in the report of an Islamic Cleric, Sheikh Burhanuddin from Ulakan (Pariaman) in the seventeenth century. Second, there is historian Nurmatias who assumed rendang as a part of the missionary movement of Islam in West Sumatra by Sheikh Burhanuddin in the seventeenth century. According to him, before the entering of Islam, there might be foods like rendang which are made from non-halal meat. Then, after entering Islam, there was the movement of halal meat consumption. If we deduce the tendency of both statements, the historicity of “processed meat” and “similar rendang” is more emphasized in the context of the seventeenth century period that was associated with the awareness of processing and consuming halal food in line with the missionary movement of Islam in West Sumatra.\nThe third opinion comes from the historian Gusti Asnan who alludes to the report of Padang Resident H.J.J.L. Ridder de Stuers in 1827. Asnan reads, de Stuers reported on the provision of dried black meat. The provisions were brought by Minangkabau traders when trading to Singapore and Malaysia via the Indragiri River and the Batang-Kwantang River. However, in my reading, I examined de Stuers’ report in two volumes of his book De Vestiging en uitbreiding der Nederlanders ter Westkust van Sumatra [10] (Formation and expansion of the Dutch on the West Coast of Sumatra), there was no mention of a kind of rendang at all.\nFrom the three opinions above, it can be concluded that rendang is closely related to the Islamic context, wandering culture, and the ethics of commerce of the Minangkabau people—three things that really reflect the Minangkabau identity. However, it is necessary to check through the reading of old sources: Since when did rendang actually become part of Minangkabau tradition?\nTo answer the question, this article discusses rendang based on sources that describe the tradition of food preservation in culinary culture in West Sumatra from the seventeenth to twentieth centuries. Through a historical approach, this research process begins with source heuristics. The sources used in this study include primary and secondary sources. The types of sources obtained include monographs, research results, cookbooks, newspapers, and magazines. After going through a heuristic process, tracking data related to rendang is processed through criticism of the source. By corroborating data from one source with the other sources, it can be interpreted that the facts about the origin of rendang until its development becomes part of cultural identity in the Malay region in general and especially West Sumatra.\nThis research specifically uses a food study approach which examines the relationship between food development and geographical space. According to Ian Cook and Philip Crang [11], food is not just a cultural artifact, but material from the results of cultural practices that can be displaced and changed through a series of processes: invented ➔ invention ➔ innovation and constructed ➔ deconstructed ➔ reconstructed. The relationship between geographical and social environment in general forms the cultural character of eating in an ethnicity. The aim of this study is to examine the influence of environmental factors in shaping people’s eating habits which are passed down from generation to generation into a culinary tradition.\nBased on this, in the case of the history of rendang, the relationship between geographical, social, and cultural factors that form rendang will be explored as part of the Indonesian culinary tradition. In this article, the narration about rendang does not focus on the scope of local culture (read: Minangkabau) only; rather, it embraces the transcultural relationship between Malay and various foreign cultures such as Indian, Islam, and Portuguese. This transcultural relationship is very reasonable, possible, and represents the real conditions of the formation of Indonesian culinary which generally results from the encounters with culinary influences of foreign cultures.\nDiscussion # The rise of rendang and condition of meat consumption # Even though at present rendang has become known globally as one of Indonesia’s famous foods, its earliest historical record is very scarce. The earliest record pertaining to rendang is a Malay manuscript from the early sixteenth century, Hikayat Amir Hamzah. This manuscript that was written during the spreading of Islam in Malay was an adaptation of the Persian classical literary work (Hamzanama) which was later compiled into Malay to encourage Malacca Sultanate soldiers to fight the Portuguese empire who wanted to conquer Malacca in the early sixteenth century. In Malay version, there mentioned the words “rendang” and “merendang” (roasting) which is quoted as follows: “\u0026hellip; Khoja Buzurjumhur Hakim pun pergi pula ke kedai orang merendang daging kambing, lalu ia berkata ‘beri apalah daging kambing rendang ini barang segumpal’” (Khoja Buzurjumhur Hakim went to the stall where people are roasting goat meat, then he said “give me just some of this goat meat rendang”) [12].\nFrom the words in bold it is clear, that “merendang” is the term for technique of processing meat and “rendang” is the processed product. At least this shows that these two words have long been a part of the Malay vocabulary. However, in the sixteenth century, there was not much written information about rendang besides of course the text of Hikayat Amir Hamzah. Besides that, if the spatial context of the manuscript text is Malacca, what about in West Sumatra? Was there also the practice of processing food by “merendang” and also food like rendang at that time in this region?\nIf in the present, Minangkabau cuisine is identical with the fleshy menu, according to the early historical record in the sixteenth century—or quite contemporaneous with when the Hikayat Amir Hamzah was written—the food consumption of natives in West Sumatra generally was so simple. This can be proof from the travel records of French poet, Pierre Crignon, who in 1529 participated in the nautical expedition of two brothers, Jean and Raoul Parmentier, visiting the Tiku region in northern Padang. Crignon reports his observations regarding the Tiku peoples’ lunch menu:\n“\u0026hellip; au repas ils ont pour tous mets un petit de ris à demi cuit à l\u0026rsquo;eau sans sel, et aucune fois un petit de poisson menu comme le doigt séché au soleil qu\u0026rsquo;ils mangent avec : et c\u0026rsquo;est un bien grand banquet quand il y a quelque coq haché par morceaux, roty sur le charbon, ou bouïlly en un peu d\u0026rsquo;eau et meslé avec le ris” [13]\n(\u0026hellip;when they eat they only have half-cooked rice cooked with water without salt, and small fish as big as fingers are dried in the sun and they eat with it: as for a meal, it is considered very special when in the meal there are several pieces of grilled chicken that are roasted over charcoal, or boiled using a few water mixed with rice). Based on the Crignon report, it can be concluded that a simple picture of the daily diet of Tiku residents often consume rice and fish. Even if there was chicken meat, its presentation and consumption was only occasional when there is a special moment. This assumption is in line with what was explained by Penny van Esterik [14], that historically, meat has rarely been the main focus of eating culture in Southeast Asia. Although in not-so-dominating culinary traditions in Southeast Asia, meat was highly valued by the people.\nOf course for a European like Crignon whose eating habits cannot be separated from meat consumption, the Tiku people’s diet is considered boring. But he did not realize that before European influence began to develop since the seventeenth century, the cultivation of livestock for the consumption of animal protein in West Sumatra was not yet massive. Even if buffalos are farmed animals, the energy of this cattle is more used for farming. In addition, buffalo also tends to be considered as a sacred animal in West Sumatra. Naturally, if livestock meat can be used as animal protein ingredients, it cannot be considered as the daily consumption.\nThe Indian influence also seems to contribute in forming the habit of less meat consumption as the daily diet of West Sumatra people. Seemingly it has still developed through the spreading of Islam to West Sumatra in the fifteenth century, replacing the traditions of animism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. One of the chronicles of Islamization is marked by the story of a new Minangkabau king who converted to Islam [15]. The development of Islam then began to spread in the seventeenth century as read from the report of a Portuguese mestizo, Thomas Dias [16], who in 1684 visited Minangkabau and witnessed the presence of pilgrims in the royal palace.

Van Ronkel in his work Rapport: Betreffende de Godsdienstige verschijnselen ter Sumatra’s Westkust (report on religious phenomenon on the West Coast of Sumatra) published in 1916 discusses the story of the famous Islamic propagator in West Sumatra in the seventeenth century, Sheikh Burhanuddin of Ulakan from Pariaman. In carrying out his Islamic law activities in Ulakan, Burhanuddin provided some interesting information regarding meat consumption among the people. One interesting story is when the Ulakan residents entertain Burhanuddin with a dish of turmeric rice and seasoned chicken. Based on his observations, the dish was processed well. Burhanuddin thought it was very appetizing and enjoyed the dish which was shown from a piece of chicken meat stuck between his teeth [17].\nThe interesting thing from what Burhanuddin enjoyed was turmeric rice and seasoned chicken. The ingredients used for seasoning are indeed not mentioned. However, this shows that in the seventeenth century, meat processing techniques using herbs had become part of domestic tastes among the Ulakan population. In processing the chicken dish that Burhanuddin enjoys, the native used herbs, in addition to turmeric, as an important spice to arouse appetite.\nHowever, in terms of meat consumption, there are interesting stories about the mission of spreading Islam by Burhanuddin. After eating seasoned chicken, he expressed his regret having eaten it. The regret was due to the way of slaughtering chicken by Ulakan residents who did not comply with Islamic law. This can be confirmed from the attitude of Burhanuddin who on another occasion in his missionary journey refused to take a piece of chicken meat that was not slaughtered according to Islamic law. Burhanuddin’s refusal was also taken towards a group of children who brought to him roasted wild boar meat. Burhanuddin then advised all their parents to leave behind everything that was unclean. After that, the natives agreed to accept Islam and to leave consumption of forbidden meat and all unclean food that was practiced previously in the animist tradition [17]. In addition to the Islamic law rules related to meat consumption, the development of Islam in West Sumatra gave rise to various tarekat (religious way) schools. One of them is the Tarekat Basoeloea which applies the rules for congregations to abstain from eating meat for 40 days and only consume once every 2 weeks [17].\nFrom Burhanuddin’s story, it is implied that what originated from the influence of Islam in West Sumatra was the propaganda of halal movement in terms of meat consumption. Another thing besides the halal movement was the limitation of animal protein consumption. Regarding the low consumption of meat in Ulakan as implied by Burhanuddin’s story, at least it is confirmed with the report of Crignon in the sixteenth century. Behind the low consumption of animal protein, the interesting thing to observe from Crignon and Burhanuddin were the meat processing technique by grilling. Until the seventeenth century, grilling seems to be a technique commonly used by people in West Sumatra—as well as in Southeast Asia [14].\nThe testimony of Crignon and Burhanuddin which implies the low consumption of meat in West Sumatra until the seventeenth century certainly needs to be confirmed by reading wider primary sources. Its important to trace since when the trail of rendang existed as part of the culinary tradition in West Sumatra. This will be interesting because both testimony of Crignon and Burhanuddin did not mention the meat preserving process as it is identical to rendang. So the question is, from where exactly does the merandang technique come from?\nPortuguese culinary influence # The expansion of Europeans to Southeast Asia since the seventeenth century began to influence also the increasing of animal protein consumption in Malay regions. At the same time, the consumption of meat and its processed products began to take root in West Sumatra. The Portuguese can be said to be one of the European nations which has contributed to its culinary influence in the Archipelago. When the Portuguese controlled Malacca from 1511 to 1641, Luso (the term refer to the Iberian culture, namely Portuguese and Spanish) cultural influence was also spread around the area. The beginning of the contact of Portuguese influence in West Sumatra itself can be factually evidenced by the arrival of Tomé Pires and João de Barros in the second half of the sixteenth century [18, 19] and Thomas Dias [16, 20] who visited the Minangkabau Kingdom at the end of the seventeenth century.\nGradually Portuguese culture was also absorbed in West Sumatra. Antonio Pinto da França [21], for example, found evidence of the similarity of the Minangkabau groom’s dress to the Portuguese clothing style. That is, if the influence of clothing itself is adopted, then it is open to the possibility of adoption of food culture. Portuguese influence in the culinary sphere spread across various regions of the world that stretched from Africa (Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, Sao Tome, Principe, Angola, and Mozambique), South America (Brazil), to Asia (Goa, Macau, Malacca, and East Timor) [22]. In Malay, the influence can be seen from the various culinary vocabulary that is actually a derivation of Portuguese vocabulary [23, 24], such as acar/pickles (absorbed from achar), belacang/shrimp or fish paste condiment (baleicho), bolu/spongecake (bolo), kaldu/broth (caldo), and mentega/butter (mentega).\nAccording to Janet P. Boileau [25, 26], a distinctive legacy of Portuguese cuisine is food preservation technique which is shown by the high consumption of meat and its various processing techniques. Portuguese-style meat processing itself includes assado (grilling), recheado (mixing meat with spices), buisado (boiling), and bafado (steaming). As for those who first absorbed Luso’s culinary influence, they were the Cristangs (Malays who had been converted to Christianity). For more than a century of Portuguese rule in Malacca, Cristang also adopted and enjoyed the patron’s appetite, one of which was the habit of meat consumption and its processing techniques [25, 26].\nHowever, after Malacca was released into the hands of the Dutch, and the Portuguese were thrown away, the Cristang people were affected by economic difficulties. They then think of ways to meet their food needs as economically as possible. Finally, they found a surefire method as did their fellow brothers in Macau (a region on the southern coast of China that became part of the Portuguese colony). The method in question is a cooking technique by preserving food ingredients (ranging from meat to vegetables). To process meat, they have to fry while stirring constantly in a tightly covered cauldron with a little water until the color of the flesh is blackish. In Portuguese, this cooking technique is called bafado. In Boileau’s research [25], this Luso–Asian culinary influence spread since the sixteenth century from around the Malacca Strait to Sumatra.\nIf we look back at the words rendang and merandang in the early sixteenth century Malay manuscript Hikayat Amir Hamzah (as previously the text has been quoted in “The rise of rendang and condition of meat consumption” section above), then this becomes interesting because this manuscript has been well-known in Malacca contemporaries with Portuguese influence when it began to develop in the Malay region. Even so, there is no detailed explanation in this Malay text on how to cook meat by merandang. However, if it is related to the Portuguese-style bafado technique, it seems interesting to examine: Is there a connection between the bafados’s Portuguese influence on merandang?\nThe following interesting interpretation from Boileau [26] seems to answer the question above: “Braising meats and then finishing them by frying is a Portuguese technique used in dishes such as Malay/Indonesian rendang. The class of Indonesian dishes called balado (‘with chilies’) probably also originated with the Portuguese”. Boileau’s description can be confirmed by checking directly the Portuguese vocabulary. In the book of Influence of Portuguese Vocables in Asiatic Languages, the author Dalgado [27] mentioned that bafado is a derivation from abafado. Abafado itself means “a dish of stew”. In the dialect of the East (Luso–Asia), abafado is commonly pronounced as bafado. In Konkani language (Indo–Aryan language spoken by Konkani people along the western coast of India), abafado is pronounced as bāphàd; and in Bengali language, it is pronounced as bāphādú [27]. At least, it can be drawn that the bafado term were adopted and turned into the word “balado” which is now more familiarly known as a popular culinary vocabulary of particularly Minangkabau and generally Indonesia. A Minangkabau-descent gastronome, Sri Owen [28], more assumes that the word “balado” in Minangkabau language means “using chili pepper”. She has a point indeed, although it needs to be added that what is used in processing rendang is not only chili, but also various spices. It should also be added that the meaning of balado is actually more of a recurrent cooking technique aimed at preserving food (for example meat, anchovies, eggs, and tempeh).\nBoth bafado and balado have the same processing purpose, which is preserving food. If we look at the geographical location of the Malacca Strait which divides Sumatra and Malaysia, then Luso’s culinary influence may be spread due to human traffic activities between two regions (Fig. 2). The activities of the Minang traders who crossed from Sumatra to Malacca or from the opposite direction while carrying the rendang provisions indicated that the food was spread through the process of giving and receiving influence. Foods such as rendang was undergoing modifications that are tailored to human tastes in certain regions. Likewise, the durable technique adopted from Luso’s influence was later modified by Minangkabau people, that is cooking meat to a high level of ripeness.\nFig. 2 figure2 Mapping area around Malacca Strait ca. 1600 adapted from Reid [29]. From the map, the geographical proximity between West Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula that mediated by the Malacca Strait can be seen. Portuguese influence, since their reign in Malacca from 1511 to 1641, allows spread in these two regions. In the past, trading activities and human migration from West Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula were woven through this strait. Rendang which is favored as a provision for the journey of the Malays also spread along with the development of the tradition of wandering\nFull size image\nThe early information of rendang in European texts # Since the beginning of the eighteenth century, the traces of rendang as Malay vocabulary began to be found in European sources. If compared with the sixteenth century Malay manuscript of Hikayat Amir Hamzah, what is mentioned in European sources more clearly is explaining rendang neither as a food product nor cooking method. In a dictionary of Dutch and Malay published in 1708, Vocabulaer of te Woordenboeck Duytsch ende Mallays, the word randang (sic.) is associated, by the author Fredericus Gueynier [30], with friccaseren. It is an old Dutch writing style for fricassee, a French method of cooking meat in which it is cut up and braised.\nOf course as a Dutch, Gueynier tried to translate the word friccaseren (as a European food which certainly he knew very well) by interpreting it synonymously with rendang. In other words, he does not really understand the historical and cultural background of rendang. Previously, it has been discussed that there is a possibility of rendang with Portuguese culinary influence in the Malay region. Nevertheless, the origin of rendang is also often assumed to have a connection with Indian influence on Malay cuisine as seen from the use of spices that seep in with coconut milk in rendang processing. India’s relationship with Sumatra itself has been established since the sixth century [31]. Both are bound by political activities and spice trade that cause cultural exchanges, including in the culinary aspect. Sumatra itself is an entrepot of typical Archipelago spices, such as cloves (Eugenia aromatica) and nutmeg (Myristica fragrans), which are sought by foreign traders since ancient times. It is also noteworthy that from the relations over the centuries, India helped bring and introduce its special spice plants to the Sumatra region, including pepper (Piperaceae), ginger (Zingiber officinale), coriander (Coriandrum sativum), and cumin (Cuminum cyminum). The inclusion of Indian spices in its development was followed by the embedded influence of Indian cuisine in the food culture of West Sumatra.\nWilliam Marsden, an Englishman who at the end of the eighteenth century traveled and observed in Sumatra and in 1811 published a complete Sumatran history book entitled The History of Sumatra, clearly states evidence of the influence of Indian cuisine in Sumatra:\n“Their dishes are almost all prepared in that mode of dressing to which we have given the name of curry (from a Hindostanic word), and which is now universally known in Europe. It is called in the Malay language gulei, and may be composed of any kind of edible, but is generally of flesh or fowl, with a variety of pulse and succulent herbage, stewed down with certain ingredients, by us termed, when mixed and ground together, curry powder. These ingredients are, among others, the cayenne or chili-pepper, turmeric, sarei or lemon-grass, cardamums, garlick, and the pulp of the coconut bruised to a milk resembling that of almonds, which is the only liquid made use of. This differs from the curries of Madras and Bengal, which have greater variety of spices, and want the coconut. It is not a little remarkable that the common pepper, the chief produce and staple commodity of the country, is never mixed by the natives in their food. They esteem it heating to the blood, and ascribe a contrary effect to the cayenne [32].”\nFrom Marsden’s observations, at least the curry as an essential element of Indian culinary tradition in the eighteenth century has become part of the culinary culture in the Malay region. Despite adopting Indian influence, Marsden reports that in curry processing, Sumatran people prefer to use chili (Capsicum) rather than pepper as a spice seasoning and use coconut milk that is commonly not used in Indian curries. The use of chili and coconut milk is more a matter of taste based on the availability of these cooking ingredients in Sumatra and the natives’ habit of consuming them. Chili is a spicy flavoring ingredient which is cultivated more recently after pepper from India. This spicy fruit was from South America and began to be brought by the Portuguese to the Straits of Malacca in the sixteenth century and then cultivated extensively by the West Sumatran people until it became the prima donna for cooking ingredients. Resident of Padang, Ridder de Stuers [10], reported on the comments of Sumatran people who tended to sweep aside the use of pepper as the main spice due to the uncomfortable heat in the stomach.\nIndian influence with the sensation of spices was also adopted in culinary practices in West Sumatra as part of the food preservation techniques, given the nature of spices which have the ability to preserve. Spices and coconut milk then became a very unique blend of ingredients in cooking activities among the West Sumatra people. Thick curry sauce that is loaded with spices in essence is used as a means to preserve food (e.g., meat, fish, and eggs). The preservation technology itself is undergoing an evolution in processing of various animal proteins, as observed by Marsden:\n“They dress their meat immediately after killing it, while it is still warm… and in this state it is said to eat tenderer than when kept for a day: longer the climate will not admit of, unless when it is preserved in that mode called dinding (sic.). This is the flesh of the buffalo cut into small thin steaks and exposed to the heat of the sun in fair weather, generally on the thatch of their houses, till it is become so dry and hard as to resist putrefaction without any assistance from salt. Fish is preserved in the same manner, and cargoes of both are sent from parts of the coast where they are in plenty to those where provisions are in more demand. It is seemingly strange that heat, which in a certain degree promotes putrefaction, should when violently increased operate to prevent it; but it must be considered that moisture also is requisite to the former effect, and this is absorbed in thin substances by the sun\u0026rsquo;s rays before it can contribute to the production of maggots [32].”\nMarsden’s observations were cursory at first glance when he explained that in processing dinding—written and pronounced by Indonesians as “dendeng”—or jerked meat, it does not rot without the help of salt. Even before being dried in the sun, jerked meat must be mixed with sugar, salt, and spices (coriander, cumin, and garlic) and then left to soak for an entire night. Perhaps Marsden did not pay close attention to the processing; or maybe he was explaining two types of processed meat with different techniques. The reason he alludes to the addition of hot temperatures to prevent the process of decaying meat and its use as provisions for travel. This explanation leads to a different way of processing with beef jerky, that is, if repeatedly heated, it can preserve the meat until it is blackened and durable. This durable nature makes it preferred to be taken as a food provision of people in West Sumatra when trading or wandering.\nMaybe Marsden missed mentioning the name of the preserved meat product. Nevertheless, Marsden cannot be blamed let alone accused of being inaccurate. It may be that the preserved meat food as described by Marsden is more of a verb to refer to a practice and how to process meat. That is why Marsden was so closely watching the process of making this preserved meat that he missed mentioning the name of the process. If only he asked the Malays what they were cooking, the answer might be “merandang” aka cooking meat with coconut milk and spices until the sauce seeps into the meat and the texture of the meat dried and blackish. However, in 1812, Marsden published his work, Dictionary of the Malayan Language, and interestingly we can find entry of rendang with the meaning of “to fry (in a vessel over the fire)” [33].\nAt least there are two things that can be concluded about rendang based on the readings of the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century European texts from Gueynier and Marsden. First, it is becoming clear that rendang is a way of cooking that is intended to preserve food. Secondly, as Marsden observed, in West Sumatra tradition, the use of spices in rendang implicitly showed a combination between Malay and Indian influences that had fused with Portuguese influences.\nRendang wandering far away # The widespread culture of wandering among the Minangkabau people in the nineteenth century unwittingly helped spread their unique rendang to each region they visited. With no exception, Negeri Sembilan in Malaysia, which since the fifteenth century has been a migration destination of Minangkabau people, has also received the influence of rendang. So, it is reasonable if Malaysia ever claimed rendang as their national identity; although in fact this neighboring country of Indonesia forgot that the people in Negeri Sembilan were of Minangkabau descent, which means they inherited cultures from their ancestors [34]. The rendang influence as a result of the meeting of Malays and Portuguese in the seventeenth century is not impossible to spread and shape a common of Malay cuisine culture with their characteristics which has scattered in Malacca Strait.\nThe advantage of processed “Rendang Minang” that lasts for months is clearly liked by wanderers and traders. Many Minangkabau men migrated to leave their hometowns and spread to various regions outside Sumatra. Aside from being the prima donna’s journey, the missing of rendang often ambushed them when they were on the overseas land. The solution is that Minangkabau men usually write to their relatives in their hometowns and beg for rendang. This kind of coexistence even infects Europeans who were infatuated with rendang pleasure. A father of Malay journalism who was also an expert on women’s ethics education in the early twentieth century, Datoek Soetan Maharadja, in his article in Soenting Melajoe magazine on 2 February 1917, reported on Europeans in Palembang, Batavia, and Kupang who wrote to Minangkabau women while depositing money via the editor of Soenting Melajoe with the intention of ordering made and sent “rendang Alam Minangkabau” (the original of Minangkabau’s rendang) [35].\nDuring the second decade of the twentieth century, preserved meat foods such as dendeng and rendang were successfully popularized through recipes published by Soenting Melajoe. In addition, the popularity of rendang also developed through the existence of Minangkabau-style lepau (food stall) in the area where Minangkabau migrants reside. Europeans who have tasted the enjoyment of rendang believe this durable meat can harden their veins [35].\nIt not only began to be excellent for Europeans. For people in West Sumatra alone, rendang becomes the most preferred choice to be used as provisions to travel far toward foreign countries. Mecca is the most obvious destination where rendang wanders far and is anchored there brought by Muslims from West Sumatra who perform the pilgrimage. Sri Owen has memories of rendang in her childhood when she lived in Padang Panjang. In around 1940s, she had witnessed her grandmother cook buffalo meat around 5–10 kg in a large skillet. The grandmother told her that rendang is an important provision for Muslims who will perform the pilgrimage. Besides being liked and known as a food supply, rendang is also considered nutritious and durable without having to be stored in a cooler and does not have to always be reheated/refried frequently so as to make rendang preferable to be stored for a long time and, at any time, can be served for family parties and salvation [28, 36].\n“Rendang Alam Minangkabau” got increasingly popular when Minangkabau migrants opened the lepau style in big cities in the Dutch East Indies (Fig. 3). Seeing its popularity, cookbook writers from the beginning of the twentieth century who wrote in Dutch and various local languages (e.g., Malay, Javanese, and Sundanese) began to incorporate rendang recipes in their works. The spread of rendang then wander off, breaking through geographical, ethnic, and racial boundaries.\nFig. 3 figure3 A rice stall or lepau in the Payakumbuh Market in West Sumatra around 1911 as documented by photographer Jean Demmeni [37]. Along with the increasing number of Minangkabau wanderers, since the end of nineteenth century many lepau have sprung up in the cities of the Dutch East Indies. In lepau, varieties of Minangkabau special foods including rendang were also served. Lepau became an important hub in popularizing rendang to the various groups of people. The relationship between rendang and lepau really cannot be separated\nFull size image For example, in 1936, a Javanese cookbook was published entitled Lajang Panoentoen Bab Olah-Olah Kanggo Para Wanita (cooking guide for the ladies) by Raden Ajoe Adipati Rekso-Negoro aka R.A. Kardinah (a sister of Javanese women’s emancipation figure, R.A. Kartini) (Fig. 4). In her cookbook, Kardinah combines recipe elements of indigenous Arabic, Chinese, and European cuisines. From 65 recipes, Kardinah put rendang in it. To make rendang, Kardinah apparently does not use buffalo or beef meat as one of the ingredients for making rendang, but she preferred to use chicken meat [38]. This modification shows that Kardinah seems to understand that rendang is not synonymous with certain meat ingredients, but rather is interpreted as a way to process food ingredients with a little water through absorption of spices until dry.\nFig. 4 figure4 A rendang recipe in a Javanese cookbook Lajang Panoentoen Bab Olah-Olah kanggo Para Wanita (1936) by Raden Ajoe Adipati Rekso-Negoro. Here is the translation of Javanese text recipe into English: “Chicken meat if it has been cleaned, then cut into small pieces, boiled until soft. Red onion slices 2 teaspoons, grilled turmeric slices 1 teaspoon, 2 chili stew, salt 2 teaspoons, 1 cup coconut milk. Shallots, turmeric, chilies, salt are ground first until soft, then coconut milk is added, mixed (stirring) until evenly distributed. Chicken stew is put into the seasoning, then dropped with one slice of lime juice, then boiled until cooked, also the spices are cooked until slightly dry”\nFull size image Besides Kardinah, in 1939, Mrs. S. Noer Zainoe’ddin-Moro from Banjarmasin (South Kalimantan) published a cookbook entitled Lingkoengan Dapoer: Boekoe Masak bagi Meisjes-Vervolgscholen jang Berbahasa Melajoe (kitchen environment: a cook book for Girls Advance-School in Malay). From a total of 80 recipes that she collected, there are 16 recipes that emphasized originating from Java, Sumatra, and Padang. Zainoe’ddin-Moro emphasizes the image of her cookbook based on Malay tastes. Here, she represented various Padang foods as the virtues of Malay cuisine. In addition, the tendency that every person who was capable of cooking accompanied by writing skills such as Zainoe’ddin-Moro will prioritize and dominate the original tastes or the variety of preparations from their region when they write their cookbook. This can be seen from the selection of more recipes from Padang than from Java and Sumatra. One recipe displayed by her is “rendang padang” [39].\nBy presenting the rendang recipe, Zainoe’ddin-Moro tried to encourage readers in any region to make their own rendang. Obviously, this is a new breakthrough in the early development of cookbooks in Indonesia, considering that in previous periods, rendang recipes were quite rare to find in cookbooks. Its long-lasting nature, as Zainoe’ddin-Moro mentions, makes rendang an excellent processed meat, especially during the period leading up to World War II (since 1940).\nRendang itself is one of the favorite foods whose recipes are demonstrated and recommended in cooking courses ahead of the war. This is evident, for example, from the recipe “Rendang (Padangsch)” in a cookbook published by the Department van Oorlog (Department of War Affairs) in 1940 entitled Kookboek ten dienste van menages in het garnizoen en te velde (Cookbooks for food service on garrisons and battlefield).\nIn terms of processing techniques, there was no difference in making rendang for war soldiers in the garrison. But there were striking things related to the amount or weight of meat for making rendang which reaches circa 7 kg. This is reasonable because rendang processing as recommended in this cookbook is to meet the intake for 150 people in the garrison [40]. As meat consumers, it seems that Europeans were well suited for rendang to meet their calorie needs both on the garrison and on the battlefield. In addition, what is emphasized in this cookbook is “Padangsch” (Padang) as the origin area of rendang.\nThe relationship between animal husbandry condition and meat supply also influences the decrease in consumption of animal protein. Practically, identical foods that use meat ingredients must be reduced in portions. This also happened in West Sumatra, where during World War II, meat was scarce. Sri Owen [41] recalled the story of her childhood, on how when making rendang, she and her family had to make it with only a few beef given extra coconut milk and red beans. In normal times, once making rendang, her family used to use meat as much as 20 kg.\nAfter Indonesia’s independence, the Minangkabau diaspora became more widespread in many areas of Indonesia. The existence of Minangkabau people in their wander land also helped popularize the image of rendang as a typical culinary of West Sumatra. Today, the hallmark menu of the Minangkabau restaurant in Indonesian cities and also abroad is rendang—alongside with other meat-based dishes [42]. From the beginning, rendang “wandered” from lepau to lepau that it builded by the Minangkabau people wherever they are. Now who would have thought that rendang grew even wider into a delicious food on the dining table and in the world!\nConclusion # Like the overseas culture inherent in the Minangkabau tradition, rendang tradition also has a long overseas trail in culinary history in the Malay region and West Sumatra. The history of rendang cannot be separated from the historical setting of the Malacca Strait for centuries as a strategic geographical area for Malay people in establishing political, economic, social, and cultural relations with various nations. Not surprisingly, foreign culinary influences from India, Islam (from Arabic, India, and Persia), and Europe helped shape hybrid culinary styles in West Sumatra.\nAfter the Portuguese conquered Malacca in 1511, gradually the Iberian cultural influence also developed in various regions around Malacca Strait complementing the preexisting Indian and Islamic culinary influences. The influence of Portuguese cuisine then blends harmoniously with Malay cuisine, especially in West Sumatra and generally in Malay regions. Rendang which has now been identified with the Minangkabau culinary culture is characteristic in terms of processing and it is actually very identical to the tradition of food preservation in Portuguese culinary culture.\nIn the Minangkabau culinary culture, rendang is not the food name, but rather the derivation of dwelling, which is a term to refer to the technique of preserving food in covered cauldron with a little water. Obviously, this is very suitable with the preservation technique in Portuguese culinary culture. The tradition of merandang is increasingly attached to the Minangkabau culture in line with the development of wandering culture since the eighteenth century. Rendang as a durable food is clearly needed by Minangkabau wanderers who migrate to various regions by taking a long time of travel for the purpose of trading, studying, and preaching. Wandering culture has become a connecting chain in attaching rendang as an important identity for the life of Minangkabau people.\nReferences # Cheung T. Your pick: world’s 50 best foods.

(1).\nWe found a HLA class II peptide receptor that is formed by mixing class II proteins from DRα and DPβ isotypes. We showed that there are four families of receptors carrying DPβ chains with either K/GGPM, E/GGPM, K/DEAV, or E/DEAV at amino acids 69/84–86, respectively. Only DPβ with K/GGPM is capable of forming a matched receptor with DRα. This motif could influence selection of HLA-DP functional variation.\nThe K/GGPM sequence was identified in the HLA-DPB1*0401 allele, and an almost identical sequence was found in the Neanderthal genome. This allele however is rare in sub-Saharan Africa. We are attempting to explain why the HLA-DPB1*0401 is a major allotype in Europe but rare in Africa. Although HLA-DPB1*0402 also contains the K/GGPM sequence it differs from the Neanderthal HLA-DP as it carries DE at amino acids 55 and 56, whereas DPB1*0401 is AA (Ala-Ala) at amino acids 55 and 56 as is the Neanderthal sequence.\nWe agree that phylogenetic trees are most consistent with early coalescence of HLA-DPB1*0401 and -*0402. However, given the unique features of HLA recombination, allele conversion, gene conversion, and selection, it seems premature to rule out the possibility of multiple gene flow events in ancient populations (2, 3). In our paper we wanted to point out that the association of K/GGPM HLA-DP proteins with HLA-DRα as well as HLA-DPα, which we documented biochemically, as a novel receptor, could have consequences for selection. We noted that one allele with these properties, closest to the Neanderthal sequence, expanded out of Africa toward Asia, hence the suggestion of a possible relationship with Neanderthals. We did not want to rule out other scenarios. We thank Drs. Ding, Hu, and Jin for their most valuable comments.\nREFERENCES # Q. Ding, Y. Hu, L. Jin Non-Neanderthal Origin of the HLA-DPB1*0401 J.

Due to increasing demand for social care and the relative workforce shortage, it is likely that a greater number and variety of robots will be introduced and implemented in the future. While the benefits of applying robots and assistive technologies are recognized, the current limitations and weaknesses have also been identified. One of these is the difficulty associated with a user-centered design, involving older adults with impaired cognitive and sensory abilities in nursing homes. In order to overcome this challenge, a project was carried out to develop a soft and compact bedside communication robot with an input/output device, connected to existing technologies (e.g. monitoring camera, biological sensor). Drawing on the principle of gemba (deference to frontline professionals’ experience, expertise and skills), users’ feedback was reflected in the iterative steps of robot development. The original soft and communicative robot was introduced and its effectiveness was tested by measuring older people’s reactions and changes in their behaviors and engagement levels. The article reports the development process and results of a small-scale evaluation study, comparing the impact of this original soft-type robot with and without its communicative functions. The human–robot interactions were captured on video, and the analysis revealed that while communicative robots reduced the psychosocial burden on older adults, positive emotional, verbal, visual and behavioral engagement was generated with the help of the non-verbal plush toy.\nKeywords Socially assistive robot · Eldercare · Communication · User-centered design · Human–robot interaction · Technology assessment\nIntroduction # The global population aged 60 years or over reached 962 million in 2017, more than twice the population reported in 1980. The pace of aging is accelerating across the world and the number of older people is projected to reach more than 2 billion by 2050. Accordingly, the number of people affected by dementia has been on the increase, and the current number (approximately 47 million, as of 2018) is estimated to reach 75 million by 2030 [1]. The World Health Organization (WHO) published a report in 2015 [2], which outlined a framework for action to foster healthy aging based on the new concept of functional ability. In order to support healthy aging and meet the increasing demand (e.g. shortage of workforce), manufacturers and policymakers across the globe are emphasizing development and production of more efficient and effective assistive technologies (ATs) including care robots. Furthermore, the recent global pandemic has affected the lives of older people particularly harshly, and reinforced the view that building capacity in health systems by utilizing technologies should be one of the public policy priorities.\nResearch shows that older people’s acceptance of care robots can be affected by the robot’s appearance, materials and functionalities [3, 4]. It is suggested that even younger users prefer soft and cuddly robots over those with a cold, hard shell [5]. However, thus far usability, user-friendliness and outcome evaluation of these care robots have rarely been tested from the end-users’ point of view [6]. Moreover, in long-term care settings, it is not uncommon that some older users cannot verbally express their needs. To address these weaknesses, a user-centered design has been introduced for socially assistive robots (SARs) and promoted in some countries [7,8,9]. Globally, the Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) framework has been proposed and used [9]. In Japan in recent years, users’ needs have been explored and identified by several key players such as the Japanese Association of Occupational Therapists and the Association of Technical Aids (established as a public interest incorporated foundation in 1987) [10]. These efforts are primarily targeted at understanding the ’needs’ of users (care recipients and caregivers) so that manufacturers, funding bodies and care providers can develop their ’seeds’ and deliver technological aids. Despite these efforts, user involvement is still a rare occurrence. This is partly because hurdles to a participatory approach remain high when the users include older adults with impaired ability. Under such circumstances, caregivers’ inputs as proxy for older people’s voice become highly important and valuable, although it should be acknowledged that this is not the same as public and patient involvement.\nIn the Japanese context, with the concept of gemba (‘actual site/field’ in Japanese), professional expertise, experience and skills have been highly valued. Originating in the manufacturing industry, gemba has been adopted in healthcare, alongside the more widely-known concept of kaizen (‘improvement’ in Japanese), even outside Japan [10, 11]. Guided by this bottom-up process and principle, frontline care professionals proactively identified the needs of care recipients, incorporated changes into the development of SARs, and received feedback from the care recipients. We hypothesized that by making SARs more user-friendly and accessible, better outcomes and a higher quality of life would result. In order to examine this hypothesis, research was conducted to assess the impact of using such SARs on older people.\nConcerning the outcome evaluation of using existing SARs, previous studies highlighted positive impacts on older people [12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]. Examples from the previous studies include the positive impact of SARs on older people’s activity and social participation [4, 21] and on older adults with moderate dementia [22, 23]. When using a soft tactile robot, the non-verbal type can elicit reactions in older people with advanced dementia [22]. On the other hand, when using verbal type SARs, research indicated that other features such as input/output devices and sound volume need adjustments and improvements in order for the care system to utilize the equipment effectively [22]. Further development of soft and cuddly SARs and the evaluation of their impact on older people in residential care settings was deemed necessary to advance the science behind the effectiveness of these care robots.\nAgainst this background, this project was launched to develop and assess a bedside communication soft robot with an input/output device, connected to a monitoring camera and biological sensor, while reflecting the needs of direct users (care professionals and care recipients). Given our previous research, the purpose was to design and develop a soft robot [23] that can be used both as a non-verbal and verbal companion plush toy, as well as a socially interactive communication tool. The effectiveness of the SAR produced was also tested. The article reports the development process of this robot named Mon-chan (a monster-looking doll bringing harmonious communications among users), and presents results of an evaluation study conducted in the nursing home, exploring future research agendas.\nResearch Settings, Robot Design and Development Process # The development process started from users’ perspectives (older persons and care professionals), extracting the core issues identified with the previous setup and using various assistive technologies (a monitoring camera and communication robots, in particular). The gemba principle drove this process with frontline care professionals representing the voice of care recipients, particularly those who are not physically mobile enough to reach and press the nurse call button when they need assistance.\nSettings and Participants # In Japan, there are different types of care facilities. The facility selected for this study is a special nursing home for older people. There are 30 residents (25 female, 5 male; 86.8±6.8 86.8 ±6.8 years old). From the group of care professionals, 4 senior staff members in the nursing home participated in the design process of the robot and the data collection. The years of experience vary from 7 to 20 (11 on average) years. In order to ensure objectivity, the analysis was conducted by three researchers who were not involved in the collection of data. Ethics approval was granted by the Social Welfare Corporation Tokyo Sacramental Ethics Committee (TS 2019- 004). Consent was sought from each participant and their family. The research was conducted between October 2019 and March 2020.\nUser-Centered Design and Development in a Nursing Home # Most conventional communication robots have a hard shell which gives a cold impression for both residents and staff. As suggested by previous research, the sense of touch is a critical element for older adults’ engagement with social robots [5, 6, 16, 24,25,26]. The hard shell also meant that physical deployment is highly restricted in the context of nursing homes, as it requires a solid surface, such as a bedside table. As the physical distance between SARs and care recipients was not adjustable, residents had difficulty hearing and understanding what SARs were saying. From the staff’s point of view, there has always been an issue of having to go to the room to see what has happened to a resident each time a nurse call button was pressed, particularly during nighttime. It was hoped that a work system, aided by ATs, could send the warning signs or visual information wherever care professionals are, so that they can arrive in time before problems such as falls occur. In the past, there were some weaknesses in the ICT environment issues, such as time lag via the Cloud and malfunctions.\nFig. 1 figure1 Overall concept and SAR development\nFull size image\nUser-centered design dictates that priority should be placed on development of a communication robot that meets their needs. The overall concept therefore was to create a soft shell SAR with an input/output device which is connected to the nurse call button and the monitoring camera. Figure 1 describes the overall concept and the development process.\nThe system requirements include the capability of (i) remotely monitoring and sending signals to care staff when help is needed; (ii) watching over older people around the bed; and (iii) providing older people with a voice-controlled alternative method to a nurse call; and (iv) small, compact and audible robot with soft and warm appearance, which can be securely hung over the bed-rail without hindering its vertical movement.\nThe first two requirements ((i) and (ii)) were fulfilled by the existing devices, which monitor the person with a bed-side infrared camera. In case of emergencies such as falls, alerts were sent to the central nursing station as well as care professionals on duty. For the third requirement (iii), a voice-controlled alternative method was considered at the beginning. However, the idea of developing and installing a two-way communication system into the robot had to be rejected for reasons of cost and time. Instead, the team decided to rely on the existing nurse call system, and this was activated when the alert was received by care staff, so that the care recipient in need of help could communicate verbally. The main focus of this project was narrowed down to fulfil (iv).\nFrom basic design to development of the interface design, the iterative, PDCA (plan, do, check, do, act) cycle method was applied (Fig. 2). The processes for the robot (exterior) design and internal functional design were separated, and the latter proceeded with the development of verbal communication functions (e.g. system design and scenarios for conversations) and non-verbal aspects.\nMuch attention was paid to the human–robot interface design, with consideration of its appearance and voice functionality. At each stage, discussions were held between manufacturers and frontline care professionals. As a result, softer plush fabrics were chosen, and the SAR made more compact, yet more stable on the bedrail using larger paws, though it was not feasible to add a variety of voice types. Table 1 shows the changes made to the design and functions of the SAR after the iterative process of consultations.\nFig. 2 figure2 Two-stage process of developing SAR “Mon-chan” using the PDCA method\nFull size image\nTable 1 Intended design and function of SAR “Mon-chan” and end product\nIntended design and function End product Design Soft and warm; appealing appearance; compact; stable on bedrail Plush fabrics used; smaller mouth/ ears; larger paws for ease of hanging Function Audible sound (tone and pace); flexibility in changing scenario type of voice; device protected from vibrations (e.g. substrate) Lower pitched voice; slower pace of speech; new colored record button; individualized scenarios; substrate covered with plastic Full size table\nTable 2 Three types of communication scenarios\nScenario common to all individuals Scenario unique to Conversations activated by monitoring camera e.g. “Soon breakfast will be served.” (6:30 am), ‘Soon it’ll be time for physical exercise” (11 am). “Did you have a good day? Please have some good rest” (8 pm) e.g. “Today you’ll have a bath” “Would you like to join today’s calligraphy class, starting soon?”, “Today you have an appointment with your doctor.” e.g. “What’s happened? Would you like to go to the toilet?”, “Staff will be here in a minute, so please wait a moment.”, “How are you today?” Full size table\nDevelopment of Conversation Scenarios # One of the key aspects of the SAR design was the set of conversation scenarios, which were developed based on daily care routines (see Table 2). Messages about meals, wake-up, and bedtime (the timing of wake-up and bedtime messages were set individually) was input for all residents. A conversation scenario about recreation and toileting was tailored for each person, reflecting their lifestyles and daily patterns. In addition, the team enabled the scenario to be adjusted for each person, based on previous recordings captured by the monitoring camera. This was particularly important for conversations taking place during the night, when residents wake up. When the movement of a resident in her room is detected, the signal sent from the monitoring sensor (installed in each room) instructs the SAR’s server to speak, and based on the created scenario, recorded voice and sound synthesis are transferred via the SIP server, and the SAR speaks to the resident. For example, the Mon-chan robot asks “What’s happened?” when the resident tries to get up. In response to her saying “I want to go to the toilet”, Mon-chan says “Staff will be here in a minute, so please wait a moment.”\nMon-chan was produced this way, and this communication robot (10 [cm] × × 7 [cm] × 5 [cm]), which looks like a stuffed animal, contains an I/O device (Table 3, Fig. 3).\nTable 3 Features of SAR Mon-chan\nInput/output device A camera/monaural microphone/speaker/power over Ethernet (POE) available Interactions Typed sentences converted into voices.

When it is used by the bedside, it is also linked with an infrared monitoring camera and a biological sensor.\nEvaluation Methods and Procedures # For this evaluation, we employed two methods (the interRAI and Video Coding Protocol-Incorporating Observed Emotion (VC-IOE)). Verbal Mon-chan was used at all times in each resident’s room for all participants, while Mon-chan, in both verbal and non-verbal mode, was tested when the latter method was used to observe each resident’s personal interactions with Mon-chan. The evaluation took place for 4 weeks during the months of February and March 2020. The video-recording and observation sessions were held in the fourth week. The interRAI is one of the standardized assessment instruments for those who receive care. These scales measure physical abilities (activities of daily living (ADLs)), cognitive impairment and quality of life. The assessment items are organized into sections dealing with issues such as cognitive patterns, communication and hearing patterns, and physical functionality [27,28,29]. The self-rated or assessor-rated interRAI scores can be used as proxy for older people’s Quality of Life (QoL). Prior to the introduction of Mon-chan, we collated residents’ scores for two categories (E: Mood and Behavior; F: Psychosocial well-being) [30], and compared them with those collected 4 weeks after the introduction of Mon-chan (Table 4). The higher the scores are, the larger the burden is on mood, behavior and psychosocial well-being. The results are presented below (Sect. 3.2).\nTable 4 Excerpt of interRAI (E: Mood and Behavior, F: Psychosocial well-being) [30],?\nSECTION E. MOOD AND BEHAVIOR E1.

[32] for observing short-term emotional changes when older persons use the pet-type robot PARO. The list of observation items include six categories “Emotional engagement”, “Verbal engagement”, “Visual engagement”, “Behavioral engagement”, “Collective engagement” and “Agitation”). This coding framework was adapted and translated into Japanese [ [32], p.380], and used for the current study (Table 5). The participants were asked to spend time with Mon-chan individually during their recreation, and their 3-min interactions were video-taped with their permission (Fig. 4). A pair of care professionals observed the interactions and took notes. This was carried out partly to test individual responses to Mon-chan, which is designed to be both a non-verbal (cuddly toy) and a verbal robot. Mon-chan in both modes was examined. Three researchers (two care professionals and one external researcher) subsequently analyzed the recorded videos, using the VC-IOE method (Japanese version). The disagreements between coders were adjusted after a few pilot recordings and discussions. The results are shown in Sect. 3.3.\nFig. 4 figure4 Verbal exchanges with Mon-chan during recreation\nFull size image\nChanges of QoL Assessed by interRAI # The overall interRAI scores for the two categories were 11.9±9.7 before the introduction of Mon-chan. Four weeks later, the scores changed to 10.2±7.9 10.2 ±7.9, which was statistically significant (p \u0026lt; 0.01). At the individual level, 57 percent of participants’ scores improved while 20 percent remained the same and 23 percent worsened. In particular, E1 “Indicators of possible depressed, anxious or sad mood” showed a marked improvement (p \u0026lt; 0.005), while E3 “behavior and mood” showed some improvements (p = 0.08). Looking at each item, E1b (persistent anger with self or others, p = 0.03), E1d (repetitive health complaints, p = 0.02), E1e (repetitive anxious complaints/concerns (non-health related), p = 0.02), E1h (recurrent statements that something terrible is about to happen, p = 0.03), these individual items for category E also indicated statistically significant improvement (p \u0026lt; 0.05). Furthermore, positive improvements were also found in E3b (Verbal abuse, p = 0.08), E3e (Inappropriate public sexual behavior or public disrobing, p = 0.08) and E3g (Absconding or at risk of absconding, p = 0.08). On the contrary, F4 (Length of time alone during the day, p = 0.39), F5 (Willingness to initiate or participate, p = 0.4) and F6 (Instability of interpersonal relationship was statistically significant, p = 0.33) did not show any change. Overall the psychosocial burden was reduced, and it can be argued that Mon-chan had a positive effect on the quality of life of the participants.\nShort-Term Emotional Changes Captured by VC-IOE # For this study, each item was given a score of − 2 (worse), − 1 (bad), 0 (no change), + 1 (good), + 2 (improvement) by the coder, observing the three-minute clip. Although it was a short-term change, a positive stimulating effect was observed for the categories (“Emotional engagement”, “Verbal engagement”, “Visual engagement”, “Behavioral engagement”). Figure 5 shows the comparison of total scores in each category between verbal and non-verbal Mon-chan. The results demonstrate particularly positive engagement with the (non-verbal) Mon-chan doll compared to that with the verbal Mon-chan robot. However there was no statistically significant difference. The combined counts of positive scores (“good” and “improvement”) accounted for more than half (55.2%) for non-verbal Mon-chan, and 42.0% for verbal Mon-chan (Fig. 5). We further investigated the data for non-verbal Mon-chan’s effect on the participants with dementia.\nFocusing on non-verbal responses, we used the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores to measure the level of dementia, as it was deemed pertinent to examine whether any patterns were detected between those scores and the results from the VC-IOE method. The MMSE is a 30-point test used to measure the degree of cognitive ability. The test includes orientation to time and place, short-term memory, attention and ability to solve problems, language and comprehension and motor skills, and the greater the scores are, the greater the ability is [31]. A mildly positive linear regression was observed (Fig. 6), suggesting that there is a possible positive pattern depending on the level of dementia. People with dementia can potentially make positive use of the Mon-chan doll. As previous studies show, even soft plush toys without communicative functions can have therapeutic impact on older people with impaired cognitive ability, with the assistance of carers.\nFig. 5 figure5 Verbal and non-verbal Mon-chan compared\nFull size image\nFig. 6 figure6 Relationship between non-verbal Mon-chan’s effect and the level of dementia (X axis: MMSE scores; Y axis: individual scores using the VC-IOE method)\nFull size image\nDiscussion # The research team aimed to develop an SAR which is user-friendly, is appealing, and contributes to better and safer care delivery. The aim was to overcome formerly observed weaknesses of SARs and draw on the views of users (residents and care professionals working on site) in the nursing home. The result was the production of Mon-chan, which was designed, developed, introduced and evaluated on site. User-centered design still remains relatively uncommon in the domain of robotics design and development for care of older people, particularly for SARs in Japan [6,7,8]. This can be attributed to several factors, including the difficulty of having a regular dialogue or forum where developers, care recipients and care professionals can meet and discuss their needs and preferences. Moreover, there has been a scarcity of research evidence to support the arguments that these SARs can improve quality of life for older adults. Because of this, stakeholders and users can be skeptical and take a cautious approach [33]. In the last few years, more research results are being published [4, 17,18,19,20], and this situation is likely to improve. There are also some studies highlighting (potential) users’ perceptions and attitudes towards care robots [34, 35]. Ethical issues have also been examined and considered by researchers and bodies such as the IEEE [36,37,38]. Furthermore, SARs can only be utilized fully when care recipients and care professionals find them both user-friendly and useful. The application of ATs in this area needs careful consideration of users’ needs and workforce development implications. Successful implementation requires multi-level thinking (from user experience and organizational processes to policy and industry context) and the understanding that technology-supported work is cooperative and embedded in organizational routines [39].\nFor this study, we also assessed the changes in interRAI scores over the 4-week period when Mon-chan was used. The results indicated that mood and behavior of the participants improved significantly, while psychosocial aspects remained stable. Simultaneously, using the VC-IOE observation framework, the findings showed positive engagement of the participants, irrespective of the difference in type (verbal vs. non-verbal). Non-verbal use of Mon-chan exceeded the expectations of this study, generating very positive engagement in emotional, verbal, visual and behavioral aspects (Fig. 5). While the mechanism through which the technology-driven system improved residents’ quality of life requires future study, it could be argued that the reflection of their voices in the design process of Mon-chan contributed to their engagement. On the other hand, the positive impact of Mon-chan with communicative functions was not clear, considering the relatively lower positive scores than those for non-verbal Mon-chan (Fig. 4). Although the improved sound quality of Mon-chan’s verbal function was noted, the interactions between care recipients and verbal Mon-chan did not yield positive behavioral or collective engagement. Therefore, as indicated by the previous study [40], the impact of verbal SARs and non-verbal plush toys on older adults with dementia is inconclusive. Further research is needed to examine the relationship and improve the communication functionalities. It is also worth investigating how we can accurately measure the impact of these SARs and ATs on the quality of life of older people. There are a variety of assessment tools such as the WHO’s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), Dementia Behavior Disturbance Scale-13 (DBD-13), Cohen-Manfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), Neuropsychiatric Inventory with Caregiver Distress Scale (NPI-D), with the interRAI being merely one of them. For our study, interRAI was deemed highly effective and accurate in capturing the changes in residents’ mood and behavior, though this merits further examination.\nThe limitations of this study include the small sample size and the absence of a longitudinal study design to examine the impact of a longer period of SAR use on care recipients, care professionals and the nursing home. The analysis of contributing factors such as organizational context, physical environment, and the impact of unanticipated disruptions to daily care routines (e.g. Covid19 pandemic) is also worth considering, although it is beyond the scope of this paper. Nonetheless, the study demonstrated the significance of care professionals’ involvement in the design and development of an original soft social robot as a way of translating the voice of older adults with impaired cognitive and sensory ability. By assessing the impact, and despite some inconclusive results, the production loop of SARs was closed, which fulfilled the principle of gemba. Whether care professionals’ involvement in SARs design, production and evaluation can lead to greater job satisfaction and a better work environment also needs further research. However, this study is well-aligned with the progress towards the RRI framework [9], with greater public and patient involvement. Future research into and development of care robots need to examine the connection between process and outcomes.\nConclusions # This study outlined the user-centered design and evaluation of a socially assistive robot within the context of a nursing home in Japan. The collaborative developmental process among different stakeholders-manufacturers, care professionals, care recipients and researchers, improved quality of life among residents. The original SAR “Mon-chan” was connected to existing ATs (monitoring camera, nurse call, and biomedical sensor), which contributed to safety and enhanced quality of care. This safety function, in addition to the socially assistive one, provides another layer of security for care recipients and care professionals. As the new coronavirus infectious disease has highlighted, there is now a new focus on the introduction of telemedicine, and applications of remote monitoring and care delivery models as countermeasures for the spread of the virus and the protection of older people in nursing care facilities. The importance of user-oriented design and development of robotics-aided care for the improvement of a care system will continue to be highlighted in the future.\nReferences # Taylor ME, Close JCT (2018) Dementia.

Auf welcher Rechtsgrundlage und unter welchen Rahmenbedingungen? Inwieweit müssen die Betroffenen über die Nutzung ihrer Daten für den Softwaretest informiert werden? Diese Fragen sollten in diesem Beitrag analysiert und beantwortet werden.\nZusätzlich handelt es sich bei der Softwareentwicklung oft um eine Form der Auftragsverarbeitung, sodass die dafür üblichen Anforderungen, insbesondere der Abschluss einer entsprechenden Vereinbarung zwischen dem Verantwortlichen und der Softwareentwicklungsorganisation, erfüllt werden müssen. Hier gibt es aber keine Besonderheiten in Bezug auf den Softwaretest, so dass auf diesen Aspekt nicht weiter eingegangen werden soll.\n1.2 Warum Testen mit Originaldaten? # Bevor wir die genannten Fragen beantworten können, stellt sich zuerst einmal die Frage nach dem Zweck des Tests mit Original- daten. Für die folgende Diskussion gehen wir von einem typi- schen einfachen Testablauf mit den Stufen Modultest (Unittest), Integrationstest und Systemtest aus.\nFür die ersten beiden Teststufen ist ein Test auf Basis von Origi- naldaten nicht geeignet, da hier normalerweise keine Soll-Ergeb- nisse für einen Soll-Ist-Vergleich vorliegen, der aber einen Kern- bestandteil der meisten Testformen bildet. Erst wenn die einzel- nen Module (Modultest), deren Zusammenwirken (Integrations- test) sowie das gesamte zu entwickelnde System (erster Teil des Systemtests) gründlich mit künstlichen Testdaten getestet wur- den und kaum noch Fehler aufweisen, kommt schon aus Sicht der Testmethodik ein Test mit Originaldaten in Frage. Bei diesem letzten Teil des Systemtests geht es um die Prüfung, ob alle real auftretenden Sonderfälle auch von der entwickelten Software be- rücksichtigt werden. Dabei wird in der Praxis meist nur geprüft, dass die Software die Daten ohne Fehlermeldungen durchläuft, da aufgrund fehlender überprüfter Soll-Ergebnisse eine Prüfung der funktionalen Korrektheit der Ergebnisse meist nicht möglich ist.\nGemäß dem Grundsatz der Datenminimierung sollte auch die- ser Teil des Systemtestes nach Möglichkeit mit anonymisierten Daten durchgeführt werden, aber je nach Rahmenbedingungen und Art des Systems reicht ein solcher Test nicht immer aus. Ein Bedarf an einem Test mit Originaldaten besteht beispielsweise bei einer Datenmigration in ein neues Kernsystem einer Versiche-\nDuD • Datenschutz und Datensicherheit 3 | 2021 163 SCHWERPUNKT\nrung. Hier bestehen einerseits hohe Anforderungen an die Kor- rektheit bzw. die systematische Prüfung des neuen Systems, die ggf. sogar gegenüber der zuständigen Aufsichtsbehörde nachzu- weisen ist, andererseits viele über Jahre entstandene Sonderfälle, die in der Entwicklung möglicherweise nicht alle bekannt sind.\nAuch bei einer Entscheidung für eine Anonymisierung der Ori- ginaldaten ist zu berücksichtigen, dass durch die bei der Anony- misierung verursachte Veränderung der Daten möglicherweise der Testzweck nicht mehr erreicht wird, weil beispielsweise be- stimmte Abhängigkeiten oder unerwartete Konstellationen in den anonymisierten Daten nicht mehr vorhanden sind.\nEine Pseudonymisierung der Daten ist in diesem Kontext da- gegen nicht relevant, da die Möglichkeit einer späteren Zuord- nung der Daten zur Person für den betrachteten Zweck des Tes- tens keinen Nutzen bringt. Wenn ein Test mit pseudonymisierten Daten möglich ist, dann ist er ohne weitere Einschränkung auch mit anonymisierten Daten möglich, und daher sollte immer die- se stärkere Schutzmaßnahme angewendet werden.\nDaneben werden Originaldaten auch für die Analyse von Feh- lermeldungen und den Test der Fehlerkorrektur genutzt, wenn ein Fehler sonst nicht nachzuvollziehen ist.\nEin weiterer Anwendungsbereich des Tests mit Originaldaten betrifft den Performanztest, hier wie üblich als Bestandteil des Systemtests betrachtet, bei dem es in erster Linie um die Ge- schwindigkeit geht, mit der eine große Menge von Daten bearbei- tet wird. Hier ist es grundsätzlich möglich, aber ggf. sehr schwie- rig, eine angemessene Menge von Testdaten einschließlich der be- nötigten Sonderfälle künstlich zu erzeugen, sodass auch hier oft der Wunsch nach der Nutzung von Originaldaten für den Test besteht.\nBisher ging die Betrachtung davon aus, dass der Test in einer separaten Testumgebung durchgeführt wird und nicht in der Produktivumgebung. Dies ist normalerweise schon aus testfach- licher Sicht erforderlich, aber es gibt Ausnahmen, insbesonde- re beim Test von Fehlerkorrekturen, in denen das nicht sinnvoll möglich ist, so dass in Einzelfällen auch ein Test in der Produk- tivumgebung erforderlich sein kann.\n1.3 Warum kein Testen mit Originaldaten? # Gegen das Testen mit Originaldaten spricht, dass im Allgemei- nen wesentlich mehr Personen Zugriff auf Testsysteme haben als das bei Produktivsystemen der Fall ist. Auch werden die Test- ergebnisse oft weitergegeben, ohne dass geprüft wird, ob sie per- sonenbezogene Daten enthalten [2]. Darüber hinaus wird durch eine solche Verarbeitung die Gefahr von Datenpannen vergrö- ßert, da die Daten auf zusätzlichen und noch nicht abschließend entwickelten und daher fehleranfälligen Systemen eingesetzt wer- den. Das gilt insbesondere, wenn der Test nicht in einer separa- ten Testumgebung, sondern in der Produktivumgebung durch- geführt wird. Darüber hinaus ist zu berücksichtigen, dass Test- daten häufig nicht die gleiche Sorgfalt entgegengebracht wird wie das für personenbezogene Daten im Produktivbetrieb gefordert und üblich ist.\n1.4 Grundlegende Voraussetzungen # Aufgrund der vorgenannten Risiken sowie des Grundsatzes der Datenminimierung sollte zwingend geprüft werden, ob (a) fiktive Testdaten generiert oder (b) die Originaldaten anonymisiert wer-den können. Die weitere Diskussion in diesem Beitrag geht da- von aus, dass diese Prüfung stattgefunden hat mit dem Ergebnis, dass der Testzweck mit fiktiven Testdaten oder anonymisierten Originaldaten nicht oder nicht angemessen erreicht werden kann.\nDarüber hinaus ist es wichtig, eine angemessene und dem Pro- duktivbetrieb vergleichbare Sicherheit der Daten bei der Nutzung von Originaldaten für den Softwaretest sicherzustellen, denn für die geforderte Datensicherheit macht es keinen Unterschied, ob Daten zu Produktiv- oder zu Testzwecken verwendet werden. Bei- spielsweise muss der Zugriff auf die im Test verwendeten Origi- naldaten restriktiv gehandhabt werden und darf nur einer mög- lichst kleinen Gruppe von Testern und Entwicklern erlaubt wer- den. Nach Bedarf ist dies durch eine Datenschutz-Folgenabschät- zung oder eine Abstimmung mit der jeweils zuständigen Daten- schutzbehörde abzuklären.\n2 Unterschiedliche Ausgangssituationen im Rahmen von Softwaretests # 2.1 Beziehung zwischen ursprünglichem Zweck und Zweck des Tests # Für die Beantwortung der vorgenannten Ausgangsfragen müs- sen aus Sicht des Datenschutzes folgende Ausgangssituationen und Rahmenbedingungen unterschieden werden:\nDie ursprüngliche Verarbeitung basiert auf einer Einwilligung als Rechtsgrundlage. Die ursprüngliche Verarbeitung beruht nicht auf einer Einwil-ligung; der Test mit Originaldaten ist Bestandteil des ursprüng-lich definierten Zwecks. Die ursprüngliche Verarbeitung beruht nicht auf einer Einwil-ligung; der Test mit Originaldaten ist vereinbar (kompatibel) mit dem ursprünglich definierten Zweck. Die ursprüngliche Verarbeitung beruht nicht auf einer Einwil-ligung; der Test mit Originaldaten ist nicht vereinbar mit dem ursprünglich definierten Zweck. Aus der Entscheidung, welcher dieser Fälle vorliegt, ergeben sich nach der DSGVO eine Reihe von sehr unterschiedlichen Konse- quenzen für die betrachtete Problemstellung, die im Folgenden ab Abschnitt 3 analysiert werden. Zuerst ist aber eine genauere Unterscheidung erforderlich, wann welcher der genannten Fäl- le gegeben ist.\n2.2 Ursprüngliche Verarbeitung auf Grundlage einer Einwilligung # Diese Fallgruppe ist separat zu betrachten, denn eine wesentli- che Eigenschaft einer gültigen Einwilligung ist ihre Bestimmt- heit, d. h. wenn Betroffene in eine bestimmte Verarbeitung ein- willigen, dann sind diese Verarbeitung und ihr Zweck relativ re- striktiv zu interpretieren. Daher ist dieser Fall bei der Definition einer kompatiblen Zweckänderung in Art. 6 Abs. 4 DSGVO aus- drücklich ausgeschlossen. Die Konsequenzen, die sich daraus er- geben, werden in Abschnitt 3 näher betrachtet.2\n164 DuD • Datenschutz und Datensicherheit 3 | 2021\n2.3 Test als Bestandteil des ursprünglichen Zwecks # Die für den Softwaretest herangezogenen personenbezogenen Daten werden üblicherweise für einen bestimmten Verarbeitungs- zweck erhoben, bei dem der Test nicht ausdrücklich enthalten ist. Auch dabei stellt sich aber die Frage, ob es sich bei der Nutzung der Daten für den Softwaretest in jedem Fall um eine Zweckänderung handelt: Unabhängig davon, ob die Verarbeitung auf einer Einwil- ligung (hier nicht betrachtet) oder einer anderen Rechtsgrundla- ge beruht, haben die Betroffenen ihre Daten ausdrücklich oder im- plizit für eine bestimmte Verarbeitung bereitgestellt, und um diese Verarbeitung durchführen zu können, benötigt der Verantwortli- che angemessen entwickelte und getestete IT-Systeme.\nDaraus lässt sich folgern, dass der Test mit Originaldaten in die- sem Fall dem ursprünglich definierten Zweck der Verarbeitung dient, es sich also um keine Zweckänderung handelt. Für die sehr ähnliche Verarbeitung zur „Wahrnehmung von Aufsichts- und Kontrollbefugnissen“ wurde in § 14 Abs. 3 BDSG a. F. explizit for- muliert, dass es sich hierbei nicht um eine Zweckänderung handelt.\nVoraussetzung dafür ist, dass das zu testende System wirklich dem Zweck der ursprünglichen Verarbeitung dient, es sich also um eine Weiterentwicklung, Fehlerkorrektur oder Migration auf eine neue technische Basis handelt und nicht um eine komplett neue Funktionalität. Außerdem haben wir den oben behandelten Fall einer Verarbeitung auf Basis einer Einwilligung hier ausgeschlossen.\nOb diese Folgerung wirklich zulässig ist, ist umstritten, aber nach Einschätzung der Autoren gibt es gute Argumente diese An- sicht zu vertreten.\n2.4 Vereinbarkeit des Testens mit dem ursprünglichen Verarbeitungszweck # 2.4.1 Vereinbarkeitsprüfung # Wenn der Test nicht Bestandteil des ursprünglich definierten Zwecks ist, erlaubt der Grundsatz der Zweckbindung (Art. 5 Abs. 1 lit b) i.V.m. Art. 6 Abs. 4 DSGVO eine Zweckänderung, wenn der neue Zweck mit dem ursprünglichen Zweck vereinbar ist.3 Der Grundsatz der Zweckbindung ist daher nicht ganz korrekt benannt, da er nicht wirklich eine Zweckbindung fordert, son- dern eine Zweckvereinbarkeit.\nUm zwischen den oben eingeführten Fällen 3 und 4 und den daraus folgenden Konsequenzen zu unterscheiden, ist also eine Prüfung erforderlich, ob der neue Zweck des Testens mit dem ur- sprünglich definierten Zweck der Verarbeitung vereinbar ist. Die dafür anzuwendenden Kriterien sind in Art. 6 Abs. 4 DSGVO wie folgt definiert:\nZur Feststellung, ob der neue Verarbeitungszweck mit dem ur- sprünglichen vereinbar ist, berücksichtigt der Verantwortliche „unter anderem a) jede Verbindung zwischen den Zwecken, für die die personenbezogenen Daten erhoben wurden, und den Zwecken der beabsichtigten Weiterverarbeitung, b) den Zusammenhang, in dem die personenbezogenen Daten erhoben wurden, insbesonde- re hinsichtlich des Verhältnisses zwischen den betroffenen Perso- nen und dem Verantwortlichen, c) die Art der personenbezogenen Daten, insbesondere ob besondere Kategorien personenbezogener Daten gemäß Artikel 9 verarbeitet werden oder ob personenbezoge- ne Daten über strafrechtliche Verurteilungen und Straftaten gemäß Artikel 10 verarbeitet werden, d) die möglichen Folgen der beab- sichtigten Weiterverarbeitung für die betroffenen Personen, e) das Vorhandensein geeigneter Garantien, wozu Verschlüsselung oder Pseudonymisierung gehören kann.“\nZu beachten ist, dass diese Kriterienliste nicht abschließend ist und außerdem die Kriterien erheblichen Interpretationsspielraum erlauben. Im Folgenden soll daher die genannten Kriterien im Kon- text des Softwaretests mit Originaldaten näher untersucht werden.\n2.4.2 Bedeutung der Kriterien beim Softwaretest # Kriterium a) betrachtet die Verbindung zwischen den ursprüngli- chen Zwecken der Datenerhebung und den Zwecken der Weiter- verarbeitung, hier also des Testens. Eine enge Verbindung besteht, wenn das zu testende System dem gleichen Zweck wie die ursprüng- liche Verarbeitung dient, es sich also um eine Weiterentwicklung, Fehlerkorrektur oder Migration auf eine neue technische Basis han- delt. Handelt es sich dagegen um eine Entwicklung komplett neuer Funktionalität, so ist die Verbindung entsprechend geringer.\nKriterium b) betrachtet den Kontext, in dem die Originaldaten erhoben wurden, und die Frage, ob es den vernünftigen Erwar- tungen der Betroffenen entspricht, die erhobenen Daten auch für den Test zu verwenden. Wenn beispielsweise bei den Informatio- nen gemäß Art. 13 bzw. 14 DSGVO eine sehr restriktive Zweck- bindung beschrieben wurde, wird eine Nutzung für den Test den vernünftigen Erwartungen eher widersprechen. Soweit das nicht der Fall ist, wird zwar kaum ein Betroffener bei der Information über die ursprüngliche Verarbeitung daran denken, dass auch ein IT-System entwickelt und getestet werden muss, um diese Ver- arbeitung durchzuführen, aber es wird i. A. auch nicht im Wi- derspruch zu seinen Erwartungen stehen.\nIn Kriterium c) ist die Art der personenbezogenen Daten zu berücksichtigen. Handelt es sich bei den für den Test zu nutzen- den Originaldaten um personenbezogene Daten besonderer Ka- tegorien, um Daten über strafrechtliche Verurteilungen oder um Daten von Kindern, dann ist eine Vereinbarkeit des Testens in der Regel zu verneinen.\nSpeziell für den Fall der personenbezogenen Daten besonderer Kategorien kommt dazu, dass hier die ursprüngliche Verarbei- tung gemäß Art. 9 DSGVO oft auf einer Einwilligung basiert, und in diesem Fall sind die Vereinbarkeitskriterien nicht anwendbar.4 Für das oben eingeführte Beispiel des Tests einer Datenmigration in ein neues Kernsystem einer Versicherung bedeutet das, dass der Test mit Originaldaten in der Regel nicht mit dem ursprüng- lichen Zweck vereinbar ist.\nKriterium d) betrachtet die Folgen der Nutzung von Original- daten beim Testen für die Betroffenen. Negative Folgen können weitgehend minimiert werden, sofern sichergestellt wird, dass der Zugriff auf die im Test verwendeten Originaldaten angemessen restriktiv gehandhabt und die Daten vor unberechtigtem Zugriff geschützt sind. Umgekehrt hat ein gründlicher Test sogar positi- ve Auswirkungen auf die Betroffenen, da damit die Wahrschein- lichkeit einer Fehlfunktion des Systems und damit von Fehlern bei der Verarbeitung ihrer Daten reduziert wird.\nSCHWERPUNKT DuD • Datenschutz und Datensicherheit 3 | 2021 165\nSCHWERPUNKT\nSchließlich fordert Kriterium e) die Berücksichtigung geeigne- ter Garantien, wozu in diesem Fall insbesondere restriktive Zu- gangskontrollen gehören. Dagegen sind die beispielhaft genann- ten Garantien einer Verschlüsselung oder Pseudonymisierung hier nicht geeignet. Eine Verschlüsselung würde die Nutzung der Daten für den Test verhindern, während eine Pseudonymi- sierung, wie oben erläutert, beim Test immer durch eine Anony- misierung ersetzt werden sollte.\n2.4.3 Sonderfall: Verarbeitung zu Archiv-, Forschungs- oder statistischen Zwecken # Neben einer Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten zu einem anderen Zweck als dem ursprünglich vorgesehenen nach Art. 6 Abs. 4 DSGVO, bietet Art. 5 Abs. 1 lit. b i. V. m. Art. 89 Abs. 1 DSGVO eine zusätzliche Rechtsgrundlage für Weiterverarbeitun- gen für Archiv- oder Forschungszwecke: „\u0026hellip; eine Weiterverarbeitung für im öffentlichen Interesse liegende Archivzwecke, für wissenschaftliche oder historische Forschungszwe- cke oder für statistische Zwecke gilt gemäß Artikel 89 Absatz 1 nicht als unvereinbar mit den ursprünglichen Zwecken („Zweckbindung“);“ Einer gesonderten Kompatibilitätsprüfung bedarf es in diesen Fällen nicht, allerdings ist dieser Sonderfall für den hier betrach- teten Softwaretest kaum relevant.\n3 Ursprüngliche Verarbeitung auf Basis einer Einwilligung # Sofern die ursprüngliche Verarbeitung auf der Rechtsgrundla- ge einer Einwilligung stattfindet, die u. a. durch ihre Bestimmt- heit gekennzeichnet ist, kann die Nutzung der personenbezoge- nen Daten für den Test nur dann Bestandteil des ursprünglichen Verarbeitungszwecks sein, wenn diese Nutzung explizit in der Einwilligung benannt ist – eine Konstellation, die praktisch wohl nur in Ausnahmefällen vorkommen wird. Ist das aber der Fall, dann ist auch eine Rechtsgrundlage für den Test vorhanden und eine zusätzliche Information der Betroffenen nicht erforderlich, da sie schon beim Einholen der Einwilligung erfolgt sein muss.\nBis auf den genannten Ausnahmefall ist die Nutzung der Ori- ginaldaten für den Test aber nicht möglich bzw. benötigt sie eine neue, eigene Einwilligung. Da aber viele Betroffene eine solche Einwilligung nicht erteilen werden, kommt eine Nutzung der Originaldaten in diesem Fall nicht in Frage, zumal dabei noch be- rücksichtigt werden müsste, dass eine erteilte Einwilligung mög- licherweise wieder zurückgezogen wird.\n4 Test als Bestandteil des ursprünglichen Zwecks # Der Test als Bestandteil des ursprünglich definierten Zwecks ist aus Datenschutzsicht am einfachsten zu behandeln. In diesem Fall ist die Rechtsgrundlage für die Nutzung der Originaldaten für den Test bereits vorhanden, und auch eine separate Informa- tion der Betroffenen ist nicht erforderlich.\nIst man sich daher von Anfang an bewusst, dass die Daten auch für Tests eingesetzt werden sollen, sollte man dies bereits zu Be- ginn bei der Information der Betroffenen berücksichtigen, und die Nutzung zum Test ist damit unproblematisch.\n5 Test als mit dem ursprünglichen Zweck vereinbare Verarbeitung # 5.1 Notwendigkeit einer Rechtsgrundlage bei einer kompatiblen Zweckänderung # Umstritten ist, ob neben dem beschriebenen Kompatibilitäts- test bei einer kompatiblen Zweckänderung noch weitere Voraus- setzungen zu erfüllen sind. Verlangt wird teilweise, dass zusätz- lich zu den Kriterien nach Art. 6 Abs. 4 DSGVO auch die allge- meinen Voraussetzungen der Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten nach Art. 6 Abs. 1 DSGVO zu erfüllen sind, da jede Ver- arbeitung nach Art. 5 Abs. 1 DSGVO rechtmäßig sein muss.5 Dies steht jedoch im Widerspruch zu den Vorgaben der DSGVO in Er- wägungsgrund 50 S. 2, der besagt, dass gerade „keine andere ge- sonderte Rechtsgrundlage erforderlich ist als diejenige für die Er- hebung der personenbezogenen Daten“.\nGegen die Forderung nach einer eigenen Rechtsgrundlage für die kompatible Weiterverarbeitung spricht, dass sie im Fall einer Zweck- änderung zu höheren rechtlichen Anforderungen führt als bei der ursprünglichen Verarbeitung, nämlich sowohl der Zweckvereinbar- keit als auch einer Rechtsgrundlage gemäß Art. 6 Abs. 1 DSGVO.\nDa derzeit unklar ist, welche rechtliche Meinung sich durch- setzen wird, gehen wir im Folgenden davon aus, dass eine zu- sätzliche Rechtsgrundlage erforderlich ist. Sollte das nicht der Fall sein, entfällt die in Abschnitt 5.2 beschriebene Prüfung der Rechtmäßigkeit.\n5.2 Rechtsgrundlage # Als Rechtsgrundlage für den Softwaretest mit Originaldaten kommt, bis auf seltene Sonderfälle, praktisch nur das berechtigte Interesse nach Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f DSGVO in Frage. Um die Rechts- grundlage des berechtigten Interesses anwenden zu dürfen, müs- sen folgende Checkpunkte überprüft werden:6\nBerechtigtes Interesse: Hat der Verantwortliche ein berechtig-tes Interesse an der Nutzung der Originaldaten für den Test? Erforderlichkeit: Ist die Nutzung der Daten erforderlich (und nicht nur nützlich) für den angestrebten Zweck der Verarbeitung? Interessenabwägung: Überwiegen die Interessen des Verant- wortlichen auf Nutzung der Originaldaten für den Test die Interessen der Betroffenen, dass ihre Daten nicht für diesen Zweck eingesetzt werden? 5.2.1 Berechtigtes Interesse # Ein berechtigtes Interesse des Verantwortlichen, die Software gründlich zu prüfen, liegt offensichtlich vor.\n5.2.2 Erforderlichkeit # Um sich auf die wirklich erforderliche Verarbeitung zu beschrän- ken, den Grundsatz der Datenminimierung umzusetzen und die Auswirkungen möglichst gering zu halten, muss der Zugriff auf die Testdaten sehr restriktiv gehandhabt werden, und es müssen geeignete technische und organisatorische Maßnahmen umge-\n166 DuD • Datenschutz und Datensicherheit 3 | 2021\nsetzt werden, so dass nur diejenigen Personen Zugriff auf die Test- daten bekommen, die diesen wirklich benötigen.\nIn einigen Fällen ist sogar ein externer Nachweis des gründ- lichen Tests der Software, evtl. gegenüber einer Aufsichtsbehör- de, gefordert. Dies gilt beispielsweise bei der bereits angesproche- nen Datenmigration in ein neues Kernsystem einer Versicherung, und in einem solchen Fall liegt ein hoher Grad der Erforderlich- keit eines Tests mit Originaldaten vor.\n5.2.3Interessenabwägung # Soweit die genannten Maßnahmen zur Minimierung der Auswir- kungen umgesetzt sind, wird es meist aus Sicht der Betroffenen keine gravierenden Gründe geben, die gegen eine solche Nutzung sprechen, auch wenn Ausnahmen und Sonderfälle natürlich im- mer möglich sind. Im Gegenteil ist es ja sogar meist im Interesse der Betroffenen, dass das System, mit dem ihre Daten verarbeitet werden, gründlich getestet wird und später korrekt funktioniert.\n5.2.4 Zusammenfassung # Wenn der hier betrachtete Fall vorliegt und der Test mit Original- daten eine mit dem ursprünglichen Zweck vereinbare Verarbei- tung darstellt, dann ist die Erforderlichkeit dieser Tests sicher- zustellen, was im Wesentlichen aber bereits bei der Prüfung der Zweckvereinbarkeit überprüft wurde.\nErgänzend dazu muss die IT-Sicherheit der Daten durch geeig- nete technische und organisatorische Maßnahmen, insbesondere Zugriffsbeschränkungen, sichergestellt werden.\n5.3 Informationspflicht # Gemäß Art. 13 Abs. 3 DSGVO bzw. Art. 14 Abs. 4 DSGVO besteht eine Informationspflicht des Verantwortlichen gegenüber den Be- troffenen bei einer (erlaubten) Zweckänderung. Im konkreten Fall bedeutet das, dass der Verantwortliche den Betroffenen Informa- tionen über die geplante Nutzung ihrer Daten für den Test zur Verfügung stellen muss, zusätzlich zur ursprünglichen Informa- tion über die ursprünglich geplante Verarbeitung dieser Daten. Diese Forderung gilt unabhängig davon, ob für den Test eine eige- ne Rechtsgrundlage erforderlich ist oder nicht.\nDas stellt in der Praxis eine erhebliche Herausforderung dar, denn es handelt sich typischerweise um eine Vielzahl von Be- troffenen, und nicht immer liegen entsprechende Kontaktdaten vollständig vor.\n6 Test als nicht mit dem ursprünglichen Zweck vereinbare Verarbeitung # Wenn der Test mit Originaldaten nicht mit dem ursprünglichen Zweck vereinbar ist, dann ist dafür sicher eine eigene Rechts- grundlage erforderlich, bei der es sich aber, analog Abschnitt 5.2, um das berechtigte Interesse handeln könnte. Unklar ist, ob dafür eine neue Erhebung der Daten erforder- lich ist, was diesen Test in den meisten Fällen praktisch unmög- lich machen würde. Das führt zurück zu der in Abschnitt 5.1 dis-kutierten Notwendigkeit einer eigenen Rechtsgrundlage für eine kompatible Verarbeitung. \nAngenommen es ist eine eigene Rechtsgrundlage für eine kom-patible Verarbeitung erforderlich. Dann kann alleine eine neue Rechtsgrundlage für die nicht kompatible Verarbeitung nicht ausreichen, da sonst die Vereinbarkeitsprüfung überflüssig wä- re. Hier ist also davon auszugehen, dass eine Verarbeitung der bestehenden Daten trotz der neuen Rechtsgrundlage nicht er- laubt wäre, sondern die Daten neu erhoben werden müssen. Ist dagegen für eine kompatible Verarbeitung keine eigene Rechtsgrundlage erforderlich, so führt die fehlende Vereinbar- keit dazu, dass eine Rechtsgrundlage für den neuen Zweck, hier also den Test mit Originaldaten, erforderlich wird. In diesem Fall ist davon auszugehen, dass die Vereinbarkeitsprüfung ge- nau für diese Unterscheidung gedacht ist und bei einer vorhan- denen neuen Rechtsgrundlage die Originaldaten ohne Neuer- fassung genutzt werden dürfen. 7 Zusammenfassung # Ein Test mit Originaldaten ist unter sehr restriktiven Vorausset- zungen und Rahmenbedingungen möglich, auch wenn er gemäß dem Grundsatz der Datenminimierung nach Möglichkeit ver- mieden werden sollte. Wichtigste Voraussetzungen sind, dass der Testzweck nicht mit fiktiven oder anonymisierten Daten erreich- bar ist, dass die ursprüngliche Verarbeitung auf einer anderen Rechtsgrundlage als einer Einwilligung basiert und dass der Test sehr direkt diese ursprüngliche Verarbeitung unterstützt, idealer- weise einen Bestandteil des ursprünglichen Verarbeitungszwecks bildet, sowie die zusätzlichen Risiken für die Betroffenen mög- lichst gering gehalten werden, insbesondere durch geeignete tech- nische und organisatorische Maßnahmen zur IT-Sicherheit und restriktive Zugriffsbeschränkungen.\nOpen Access # Dieser Artikel wird unter der Creative Commons Namensnen- nung 4.0 International Lizenz veröffentlicht, welche die Nutzung, Vervielfältigung, Bearbeitung, Verbreitung und Wiedergabe in jeglichem Medium und Format erlaubt, sofern Sie den/die ur- sprünglichen Autor(en) und die Quelle ordnungsgemäß nennen, einen Link zur Creative Commons Lizenz beifügen und angeben, ob Änderungen vorgenommen wurden.\nWeitere Details zur Lizenz entnehmen Sie bitte der Lizenzin- formation auf http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.de.\nDuD • Datenschutz und Datensicherheit 3 | 2021 167\nLiteratur # Download to read the full article text Literatur\n[1] Der Hamburgische Datenschutzbeauftragte.

Mather\nAbstract # Understanding how large eruptions and landslides are recorded by seafloor morphology and deposits on volcanic island flanks is important for reconstruction of volcanic island history and geohazard assessment. Spectacular fields of bedforms have been recognised recently on submerged flanks of volcanic islands at multiple locations worldwide. These fields of bedforms can extend over 50 km, and individual bedforms can be 3 km in length and 150 m in height. The origin of these bedform fields, however, is poorly understood. Here, we show that bedforms result from eruption-fed supercritical density flows (turbidity currents) in some locations, but most likely rotational landslides at other locations. General criteria are provided for distinguishing between submarine bedforms formed by eruptions and landslides, and emphasise a need for high resolution seismic datasets to prevent ambiguity. Bedforms associated with rotational landslides have a narrower source, with a distinct headscarp, they are more laterally confined, and internal bedform structure does not suggest upslope migration of each bedform. Eruption-fed density currents produce wide fields of bedforms, which extend radially from the caldera. Internal layers imaged by detailed seismic data show that these bedforms migrated up-slope, indicating that the flows that produced them were Froude supercritical. Due to the low density contrast between interstitial fluid and sediment, the extent and dimensions of submarine eruption-fed bedforms is much greater than those produced by pyroclastic density currents on land. © 2018 The Author(s).

Introduction # Silicic caldera-forming eruptions and landslides on volcanic islands represent some of the highest sediment flux events on Earth. They can transport tens to hundreds of cubic kilometres of material (Pyle, 1995, Hunt et al., 2013), most likely over a few hours to days. Both caldera-forming eruptions and landslides are extremely hazardous for local populations, and can generate far-travelling tsunami that effect more widespread distal coastlines. Explosive eruptions produce large amounts of material that can be rapidly transferred from the vent to submarine slopes and basins via volcaniclastic density flows (Cas and Wright, 1991, Allen et al., 2012). The landslides that occur on volcanic flanks can be unusually large, and involve both the subaerial and submarine domains of the edifice (White, 2000, Masson et al., 2006, Watt et al., 2012). Further, they can also evacuate material to surrounding basins through density flows (Le Friant et al., 2015, Watt et al., 2015). It is therefore important to understand how eruptions and landslides are recorded on submerged volcanic island flanks, and to distinguish between caldera-forming density current deposits and large submarine landslides as they pose distinctly different types of hazards.\nWorldwide, recent work has recognised extensive fields of bedforms on submerged volcanic island flanks (Wright et al., 2006, Silver et al., 2009, Gardner, 2010, Leat et al., 2010 and references therein) that are some of the largest amplitude bedforms yet documented on the seafloor (Fig. 1; Symons et al., 2016). ‘Bedform’ is used here to denote undulations without any reference about their origin. These undulating areas of seafloor can extend for over 50 km, and individual bedforms have wavelengths up to 3 km, and wave heights of 10–150 m. However, the origin of these bedforms is uncertain. As shown by debate over the origin of such bedforms in non-volcanic settings, they can potentially result from both rotational landslide blocks and remoulding of the seabed by density flows (Lee et al., 2002).\nFig. 1.

Identified submarine bedform fields are extensive and contain large amplitude bedforms. In contrast, subaerial volcanic flank bedform fields are less extensive and contain smaller-scale bedforms associated with terrestrial dilute pyroclastic density currents (e.g. Sigurdsson et al., 1987, Branney and Kokelaar, 2002, Brown and Branney, 2004), or irregular hummocky terrain formed by debris avalanches and landslides (e.g. Crandell et al., 1984, Cas and Wright, 1991). We therefore seek to understand what the contrasting dimensions of submarine and subaerial bedform fields can tell us about important general differences between subaerial and submarine volcanic mass flows (Moorhouse and White, 2016).\nEruption-fed submarine density flows sourced from either subaerial or submarine vents can be initiated by either collapse of eruption columns or disintegration of active lava domes (Cas and Wright, 1991, Kokelaar and Busby, 1992, Head and Wilson, 2003). Sediment waves (cyclic steps, anti-dunes, etc.) and scours are thought to be the submarine slope expression of these flows (Kostic and Parker, 2006, Spinewine et al., 2009, Cartigny et al., 2011).\nFailure of submarine volcanic shelves and slopes can result from earthquakes, edifice uplift, magma intrusion and extrusion or the sudden accumulation of large volumes of pyroclasts during volcanic eruptions (Watt et al., 2014). These failures commonly affect deep substrate and terminate proximally at steep headwall scars (Masson et al., 2006). Landslide deposits include rotated domains, huge individual blocks, and various types of density flow deposits (Masson et al., 2006, Watt et al., 2015). Landslide deposits made up of rotated blocks can form an undulating seafloor that shares some surficial similarities to sediment waves emplaced by eruption-fed density flows (Lee et al., 2002, Leat et al., 2010). This can make it difficult to distinguish landslide block and sediment flow deposits, as previously noted for bedforms in non-volcanic sites (Lee et al., 2002).\nOur lack of understanding of proximal submarine volcanic slope deposits is a consequence of the lack of attention that they have received. Basin records of volcanic deposits are relatively well understood from the rock record (Trofimovs et al., 2006, Allen and McPhie, 2009, Jutzeler et al., 2014a) and ocean drilling (Nishimura et al., 1991, Le Friant et al., 2015, Busby et al., 2017). In contrast, scientific drilling has never been successful in proximal environments (ODP135; IODP340), high-resolution geophysical data is limited (Gardner, 2010, Leat et al., 2010; Casalbore et al., 2014a, Casalbore et al., 2014b), and extensive subaerial exposures of these deposits are rare and often incomplete (Cas and Wright, 1991, Allen and McPhie, 2009).\n1.1. Aims # Our overall aim is to understand the origin and wider significance of extensive fields of bedforms on volcanic island flanks, whose occurrence has been recently recognised in locations worldwide. We first consider bedforms on the flanks of Macauley and Raoul Islands in the Kermadec Arc, using particularly detailed seismic surveys and bathymetric mapping data. We provide general criteria for distinguishing between deposits from eruption-fed density flows and landslides (Table 1). We show how these general criteria can help to understand the origin of submarine bedforms at other volcanic islands, and emphasise the need for detailed seismic surveys to reduce ambiguity. We conclude by discussing why similar extensive and well-developed bedforms are not formed subaerially, and what this may tell us about eruption-fed density flows and landslides in general.\nTable 1. Geomorphic matrix providing general criteria for initial interpretations of whether bedforms are generated by eruption-fed density flows or landslides based on swath bathymetry.\n2. Geologic setting # Macauley and Raoul Islands are located in the intra-oceanic Kermadec Arc (Fig. 2), being the uppermost subaerial edifices of two active, voluminous submarine stratovolcanoes (Wright et al., 2006, Shane and Wright, 2011, Barker et al., 2013). Onshore Macauley Island, basal deposits comprise basaltic lavas and phreatomagmatic deposits, overlain by the Sandy Bay Tephra Formation and younger basaltic lavas. The 5.7 ka Sandy Bay Tephra is exposed in cliffs 15–100 m high, and is the only confidently known silicic activity related to this volcano (Smith et al., 2003, Shane and Wright, 2011). It is made up of \u0026gt;30 flow units from wet pyroclastic density currents, most likely associated with a large magnitude submarine explosive eruption originated from the now-submarine caldera lying to the northwest of the island (Lloyd et al., 1996, Wright et al., 2006). In contrast, the last 4 ka on Raoul Island are dominated by ∼15 km3 of deposits from multiple dry or phreatomagmatic silicic explosive eruptions linked to two summit calderas (Rotella et al., 2014).\nFig. 2 Download : Download high-res image (432KB)Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2.

Data and methods # Kongsberg EM300 30 kHz multibeam echo-sounder and multichannel seismic data were acquired around Macauley and Raoul Islands during May 2007 onboard RV Tangaroa (TAN0706) and comprises one of the most detailed datasets yet for bedform fields on volcanic island flanks. The multibeam data are gridded to a 25 m cell size with a vertical resolution \u0026lt;1% of water depth. A total of 5 multichannel seismic lines were collected around the two islands using a GI airgun source and a 48 channel streamer. A seismic velocity of 1600 m/s was used to convert two way travel time to depth on all seismic profiles.\nUsing the bathymetry data, analysis of each bedform field was carried out by first categorising the morphologies of the bedforms within each bedform field. Bedforms were categorised as either convex, concave or linear in planform. Second, the wavelength and wave height of each bedform was catalogued. As part of this analysis, the upslope limb length and downslope limb length of each bedform was recorded; combined with the seismic data, this enabled bedform symmetry to be analysed. Third, the setting of each bedform field was analysed, i.e. are the bedforms confined by a definitive lateral margin or are they unconfined. Fourth, each bedform field was analysed for any notable additional features such as an identifiable headscar. Analysis of the seismic data from the bedform fields was carried out using automatic picking routines in Kingdom Suite. This was followed by manual picking of the seismic reflectors in order to ensure greater accuracy, and identify any artefacts present in the automated routines.\n4. Results # 4.1. Eruption-fed sediment waves – Macauley Volcano # Repetitive bedforms have developed over large parts of the southwest and northern flanks of Macauley Volcano (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). These semi-continuous undulations extend outwards for over 20 km, from a major break-in-slope formed by the external rim of the submarine caldera. In planform these bedforms have a repetitive convex morphology and have poorly defined lateral margins. The wavelengths of bedforms on the caldera\u0026rsquo;s southern flank decreases downslope from 1500 to 250 m, whilst their amplitude decreases from 140 to 10 m.\nFig. 3 Download : Download high-res image (544KB)Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3.

Separated from this facies by a stratigraphic unconformity, a series of thin, ordered lower amplitude reflectors are apparent. The lower amplitude reflectors make up the bedforms themselves (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). An internal unconformity is also identifiable within the lower amplitude reflectors. The strength of the reflector that marks this unconformity is highly variable along the seismic line (Fig. 4). Our interpretation of this unconformity is marked by the green line in Fig. 3, Fig. 4, and represents either a change in the seismic character of the reflectors (e.g. an abrupt change in orientation), a truncation of other reflectors, or a specific higher amplitude reflector (see Fig. 4). If this surface represents a significant unconformity, then there are \u0026gt;20 planar reflectors beneath this surface and \u0026gt;30 above.\nFig. 4 Download : Download high-res image (1006KB)Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4.

Above the basal reflector each bedform is made up of two sets of internal reflectors with contrasting seismic characteristics. e) Shows the interpreted internal unconformity in each bedform and the interpreted stratigraphic unconformity which separates the sediment waves from the underlying substrate. e) Trace of seismic reflectors visible within the bedforms.\nThe planar reflectors below the interpreted unconformity are truncated at high angles on their lee sides (Fig. 4). Each reflector is truncated by the proposed unconformity (Fig. 4f). The upslope limb length of the bedforms in this lower set of reflectors is on average 1.84 times the length of the downslope limb length. The greater upslope limb length of bedforms in the lower set of reflectors defines this set of reflectors as asymmetric.\nIn comparison, the upper set of reflectors are more clearly defined and well-developed. These reflectors conform to the underlying interpreted unconformity. The reflectors in the upper set have a dome-like apex, and their lee sides are thin but not truncated, instead becoming unresolvable in the seismic data (see Fig. 4b–d). As a result, the upper set of reflectors that make up the bedforms are more symmetrical. The upslope limb is on average only 1.55 times the length of the downslope limb. In some bedforms, some continuous and well-layered reflectors can be traced from one flank to the other, but it is difficult to correlate reflectors between one bedform and the next.\nProximal to the caldera, where the wave amplitudes are greatest, the regular reflectors cut into the chaotic reflector patterns which are thought to represent the underlying substrate. Ponded facies have also developed closest to the break-in-slope indicated by the chaotic reflector patterns on the seismic data (Fig. 4).\nThe total bulk volume of these bedforms around the whole island is at least ∼27.5 km \\(^3\\) , with ∼17.5 km \\(^3\\) on the calderas southern flank, and ∼10 km \\(^3\\) on the northern flank. This volume estimate uses the basal scoped reflector, shown in orange on Fig. 3.\n4.1.1. Emplacement mechanism # A number of possible mechanisms exist which could have resulted in the emplacement of the observed bedforms. First, they could be emplaced by poorly confined sediment density flows resulting from the radial collapse of an eruption column. In this instance, each bedform is a consequence of flow interaction with the sedimentary bed. The bedform architecture results from sediment deposition occurring mainly on the upcurrent flank of each bedform, while erosion and lower rates of erosion dominate the downstream flank. The bedforms migrate upslope and prograde upcurrent as a result of these flows. Second, the observed bedforms could be a consequence of sediment density flows unrelated to an eruption. Third, they could be the surface expression of a single (or multiple) submarine landslide(s), each bedform resulting from the downslope movement of material. In this case the internal architecture of the bedforms is a consequence of the deformation of material contained within each slide block during its downslope transition.\nOf these possible emplacement mechanisms, we interpret the bedforms to the southwest of Macauley Volcano to have originated as a consequence of eruption-fed density derived from eruption column collapse; the bedforms originating as a consequence of instabilities between a flow and the sedimentary bed. We favour this interpretation for the following reasons.\nThe bedform crests are radially extensive and sub-parallel to the caldera rim which fan out in a regular pattern, as might be expected for voluminous, poorly-confined sediment density flows formed by radial collapse of an eruption column.\nThe bedforms do not originate from a distinct headscarp, nor are they strongly confined by submarine valleys, as might be expected for a landslide.\nPerhaps most importantly, our interpretation of the regular reflectors incised into the underlying substrate as troughs suggests that these bedforms are not related to landslide activity. Were these bedforms related to landslides, translation of material would result in deformation within each slide block and thus may produce the internal reflector patterns observed (Hampton et al., 1996). It would, however, be unlikely to periodically erode into the substrate below the failure surface.\nNo compressional zone is identifiable on the bathymetry or seismic data as might be expected from a landslide.\nThe bedform wavelength and amplitude is similar to that produced by fine-grained and mainly supercritical turbidity currents in non-volcanic settings (see Fig. 1).\nAn origin for the bedforms being generated from sediment density flows that are unrelated to eruptions is discounted. It is not obvious how such energetic flows, which are needed to erode several tens of meters into the subsurface, could have originated from a narrow submerged caldera rim (Fig. 3a). An eruption source is also more likely given the nearby caldera.\n4.1.2. Sediment density flow characteristics # Having interpreted sediment density flows as responsible for the emplacement of the observed bedforms, the bedform morphology and internal architecture will now be analysed to suggest bedform type and therefore the possible flow dynamics which resulted in their emplacement (see Fig. 5). The bedforms symmetry and internal architecture suggests that stoss-side deposition and lee-side erosion occurred during their formation. This suggests that the bedforms migrated upstream and thus we can exclude any bedform type which is downstream migrating. This leaves two candidates for the bedforms; anti-dunes and cyclic steps. In comparison to anti-dunes, cyclic steps are considered to generally be longer wavelength and more asymmetrical bedforms (Cartigny et al., 2011). They are characterised by depositional subcritical flow over their stoss side and erosive supercritical flow over their lee side. The systematic transition between the two flow states is characterised by a hydraulic jump (Kostic and Parker, 2006). Meanwhile anti-dune bedforms form in phase (i.e. the flow elevation mimics the bed elevation) with surface waves in a supercritical flow (Cartigny et al., 2011).\nFig. 5 Download : Download high-res image (151KB)Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. a) and b) Section-view cartoons showing the envisaged formation of bedforms beneath eruption-fed density flows flowing from right to left. a) Cartoon shows morphology and internal structures of suggested cyclic steps that imply up-slope migration of the bedforms under high Froude numbers. b) Morphology and internal structures of shorter more symmetrical bedforms, which are more characteristics of a series of anti-dunes.\nIn the lower part of the stratigraphy (see Fig. 4), the internal reflectors of the longer wavelength bedforms are strongly asymmetric. In contrast, the internal reflectors in the upper part of the stratigraphy are shorter and more symmetrical. We therefore interpret this geometry to be representative of cyclic step deposits overlain by a series of anti-dunes. Superposition of more symmetrical bedforms on top of longer cyclic steps as has been previously observed in experiments (Cartigny et al., 2014) and modelling (Kostic, 2014). This superposition often reflects a drop in Froude number through time (Cartigny et al., 2014, Zhong et al., 2015). However, in both cases the bedform emplacing flow is dominated by supercritical flow conditions.\nDistally, the boundary between the two sets of waves is not resolvable, and the wavelength and wave height decrease away from source (Fig. 2b). This may indicate that sediment concentration, grain size, and/or velocity decreased with distance, reducing the flow\u0026rsquo;s ability to modify the seafloor.\n4.1.3. Attributing the sediment density flow to an eruption # Seafloor sampling reveals the uppermost sequence of the sediment wave fields offshore Macauley Island is covered by pumice clasts from multiple eruptions (Barker et al., 2012, Barker et al., 2013). Interestingly, Sandy Bay Tephra compositions were not identified, indicating that at least part of the uppermost stacked planar bedded seismic reflectors (Fig. 2) were not related to the 5.7 ka eruption. Current seismic data suggests a maximum burial depth of a few tens of meters below the seafloor. However, coring and further geochemical analyses will be required to resolve the exact post-climactic eruption sediment thickness and the timing of the eruption(s) that generated the conspicuous wave fields.\n4.2. Submarine landslides – Raoul Island # The submarine flanks of Raoul Island are characterised by large areas of wavy seafloor morphology (Fig. 2, Fig. 6). A series of bedforms occur to the west and south of the Island. Each bedform train contains at least 30 individual bedforms. These bedforms have concave or linear crests when analysed in planform (Fig. 6). Each bedform train originates at an arcuate headwall located near to the shelf break, extends downslope for ∼10 km, and occur on relatively steep slopes (5°). They are confined to a zone that is 0.5–2 km wide and have sharp lateral boundaries. Individual bedforms are strongly asymmetrical (the upslope limb being 1.65 times longer than the downslope limb) with wavelengths of ∼650 m and heights up to 80 m in proximal areas. Distally, the bedforms become more symmetrical (the upslope limb is 1.09 times longer than the downslope limb) and smaller in height (10 m).\nFig. 6 Download : Download high-res image (884KB)Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6.

Figures show possible rotated blocks, displaced mass and a possible basal sliding surface. e) Detailed extract of line A′–B′ showing the internal architecture of the bedforms. Although poorly imaged, the downslope limbs of the bedforms are inferred to be associated with listric faults that are connected to a basal surface.\nThe seismic data from the bedforms offshore Raoul Island (Fig. 6b, c) are more chaotic than those seen from the Macauley Volcano bedforms (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). This is partly a consequence of the Raoul seismic line not being perfectly perpendicular to the bedform crests, as was the case for Macauley. Although the noise within the Raoul seismic data makes it difficult to define internal layering, these bedforms do not clearly exhibit the internal reflectors visible in the Macauley Volcano seismic data. Instead, a seismic transect from the western slope of Raoul Island shows a chaotic seismic unit which is bounded at its base by an interpreted scoop-shaped basal surface which truncates well-bedded, seaward-dipping planar stratigraphy beneath. The chaotic seismic unit is interpreted as probable back-rotated stratigraphy, dissected by inferred normal faults. A second basal scoop-shaped surface is also visible suggesting that the one chaotic unit is made of two separate units. The end of the shear surface cannot, however, be defined. Some of the Raoul Island bedforms end in a toe-shaped area of positive bathymetric relief, which is ∼40 m higher than the surrounding seafloor. The greater symmetry of bedforms in the distal parts of these bedform fields may also be a consequence of the compression of sediment in these locations as a consequence of landslide processes.\n4.2.1. Emplacement mechanism # The geomorphology and seismic stratigraphy of these bedforms is consistent with that of previously described submarine landslides (Hampton et al., 1996, Shea et al., 2008, Watt et al., 2014). It could be proposed that these bedforms were generated by eruption-fed density flows, which were relatively thin and thus confined within gullies. Equally, it has previously been proposed that small mass-wasting events have led to the formation of crescent-shaped bedforms through the downslope evolution of these flows, such as offshore volcanoes in the Aeolian Archipelago (Romagnoli et al., 2013; Casalbore et al., 2014a, Casalbore et al., 2014b). However, it is likely that eruption-fed density flows would be less confined than the presented examples and would lead to a gradual transition to overbank bedforms not seen here. Some of these bedforms might also originate via turbidity currents initiated at the shelf edge by non-eruptive processes (cf. Hughes Clarke, 2016), although the limited hydrologic system of Raoul Island prevents large-scale fluvial input to the ocean. Nevertheless the abrupt initiation of the bedforms at a distinct head scarp favours a landslide origin, and the scale of these bedforms is larger than those formed by non-volcanic density flows in similarly confined settings, where bedforms typically have wavelengths of \u0026lt;200 m, and heights of \u0026lt;10 m (Symons et al., 2016).\nWe interpret these bedform trains as most likely the result of slope failure for the following reasons.\nBedforms trains originate abruptly from a distinct arcuate headwall, which is most consistent with landslides.\nThe bedform trains are laterally confined in valleys, and absent on intervening interfluves.\nThere is some evidence in the seismic data for backward-rotated blocks.\nA toe-shaped area of positive bathymetric relief exists at the base of the slope which we interpret to represent the compressional zone exhibited by other known submarine landslides (Hampton et al., 1996). The greater symmetry of bedforms in the distal parts of these bedform fields may also be a consequence of the compression of sediment in these locations as a consequence of landslide processes.\nTogether this evidence suggests that the identified bedforms are the result of slope failure. However, it must be acknowledged that eruption-fed density flows cannot be ruled out as the formative process and therefore further higher resolution seismic data is needed to be certain (Table 1).\n5. Discussion # 5.1. A global comparison of volcanic island bedforms # Although spectacular, the bedform fields observed on the flanks of Macauley Volcano and Raoul Island are not unique. Bedform fields have been observed on the submarine flanks of volcanic islands worldwide in other subduction zone, collision zone and hot spot settings (see supplementary Table 1). These sites include Stromboli (Kidd et al., 1998), Canary Islands (Wynn et al., 2000), the Bismark Volcanic Arc (Hoffmann et al., 2008, Silver et al., 2009), the West Mariana Arc (Gardner, 2010), South Sandwich Islands (Leat et al., 2010), Reunion Island (Sisavath et al., 2011) and the Madeira Archipelago (Quartau et al., 2018). Nonetheless it has often been difficult to unambiguously infer the origin of these bedforms (Quartau et al., 2018). The following section will therefore compare the bedform fields observed offshore Macauley Volcano and Raoul Island with other identified bedform fields and outline a set of general criteria for determining bedform origin.\n5.1.1. Are Macauley Volcano and Raoul Island bedforms unique? # Macauley Volcano and Raoul Island bedforms reported in this study have wave heights ranging from 10 m to 140 m and wavelengths of 250 m to 2000 m. Globally, reported bedform wave heights have been reported ranging from 2.5 m to 340 m (see Fig. 1; Babonneau et al., 2013, Leat et al., 2013). Globally, wavelengths vary between 10 m and 3.5 km (Moore and Chadwick, 1994; Ollier et al., 1998). Although larger than average (see Fig. 1), the wave heights and lengths reported in this study are therefore fairly typical of bedform sizes reported in other locations.\nThe planview morphology of the Macauley and Raoul bedforms varied from convex to concave with some classified as wavy (see Fig. 2 and Table 1). Their setting was also variable; some bedform fields were confined between sidewalls (see Fig. 6) whilst others remained unconfined (Fig. 3). The confined bedforms were often associated with a distinct upper headscarp. The morphology of these features is similar to those seen on other volcanic islands. The northern flanks of La Palma exhibit a series of unconfined convex, sinuous and bifurcating bedforms which are parallel to the regional slope (Wynn et al., 2000). They also exhibit internal architectures similar to those described for the bedforms offshore Macauley Island (see Section 3). In contrast, the flanks of Montagu and Bristol Islands are characterised by laterally confined bedforms near to the shelf edge which are associated with arcuate headwalls (Leat et al., 2010, Leat et al., 2013). These bedforms are similar to those interpreted as landslide sourced offshore Raoul Island (see Section 3). The bedforms reported in this study are therefore fairly typical of bedforms seen on other volcanic islands and are thought to be the result of similar processes. Observations/interpretations from Macauley and Raoul should therefore be able to inform the interpretation of other volcanic island bedforms.\nOne specific type of submarine bedform field type observed elsewhere is, however, absent from Macauley Volcano and Raoul Island. On a number of large volcanic islands (e.g. Reunion, Madeira etc.) bedforms associated with the mouths of fluvial systems have been identified (Babonneau et al., 2013; Lebas et al., 2011; Quartau et al., 2018). A consequence of sediment gravity flows related to fluvial discharge and deposition of sediment rather than volcanic activity, the wave height and wavelength of these bedforms is limited compared to their volcanically sourced counterparts. They are also found in association with deep-sea fan systems (Sisavath et al., 2011).\n5.1.2. General criteria for determining bedform origin # The presented bathymetry and seismic data in this study suggests that widespread bedforms that fan out radially from a caldera suggest eruption-fed density flows (i.e. Type 1 bedforms in Table 1), whereas a distinct upper headscarp conversely favours a landslide origin. The strongest evidence for eruption-fed density flows comes from seismic data that can resolve internal layering within bedforms (Fig. 4b). Where such layering indicates up-slope migration, it indicates formation through supercritical density flows. Rotation of planar-bedded blocks within a landslide can also form up-slope dipping reflectors, thus continuous internal reflectors are needed to preclude a landslide origin (Lee et al., 2002). Detailed seismic data is thus critical for determining the origin of bedforms with confidence, as was also found for studies of bedforms in non-volcanic settings (Lee et al., 2002). Although difficult to obtain due to the coarseness of volcanic sediment (Jutzeler et al., 2014b), sediment cores may increase confidence in how bedforms originate, especially if dating shows the bedforms are coeval with a known subaerial eruption.\n5.1.3. Applying the criteria to bedforms from other volcanic islands # From our observations of bedforms offshore Macauley Volcano and Raoul Island, we therefore propose general criteria for understanding the origin of such bedforms (Fig. 7 and Table 1). To assess the applicability of these criteria, we now consider bedforms offshore from the South Sandwich Islands and New Britain.\nFig. 7 Download : Download high-res image (402KB)Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Summary of observations enabling the identification of bedforms resulting from eruption-fed density flows (type 1) and landslides (type 2), as outlined in Table 1. a) Eruption-fed bedforms on the south-western flank of Macauley Volcano (Fig. 2). b) Landslide-generated bedforms on the western flank of Raoul Island (Fig. 3). The seafloor in a) and b) is a 3D representation of the hill-shaded bathymetry.\nOriginally reported by Hoffmann et al., 2008, Hoffmann et al., 2011, the flanks of Dakataua Caldera and Kimbe Bay in the New Britain Arc (Figs. 8a and 8b) are characterised by bedforms similar to those described on Macauley Volcano. Here, wavelengths range from 500 to 3700 m, and heights from 10 to 100 m. The bedforms are mostly asymmetrical (steeper and shorter lee sides) and decrease in wavelength downslope. Chirp sub-bottom data through the Kimbe Bay wavefield suggests thicker sediment packages on the upslope limb of waves and upslope migrating sediment packages (Hoffmann et al., 2008), therefore similar to those identified as Type 1 (eruption-fed in Table 1).\nFig. 8 Download : Download high-res image (670KB)Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8.

Bedforms offshore Dakataua Caldera and Kimbe Bay are mostly asymmetrical and decrease in wavelength and wave height downslope. These bedforms are therefore consistent with eruption-fed density flows. Bedforms offshore the Candlemas Islands and Zavodovski are mainly associated with arcuate headwalls at the shelf edge, are confined within gullies within the upper slope, and wavelength and waveheight decreases with distance offshore. These characteristics suggest a landslide origin (Table 1). Bedforms east of Zavodovski may also have been the result of later eruption-fed density flows (see text for details). In all cases, detailed seismic data are needed for unambiguous identification of bedforms that are produced by landslides and eruption-fed density flows (cf. Lee et al., 2002).\nThe flanks of the Candlemas Islands and Zavodovski Island (South Sandwich Arc) are characterised by bedforms originating at arcuate headwalls, and are laterally confined on the upper slope (Figs. 8c and 8d). These bedforms have lengths from 830 to 2500 m, and heights from \u0026lt;10 to 150 m (Leat et al., 2010). The bedforms observed offshore the Candlemas Islands and nearby Adventure Volcano (Leat et al., 2013) are similar to those identified as landslide-generated offshore Raoul Island and can therefore be categorised as Type 2 (due to landslides) in Table 1. The origin of bedforms offshore Zavodovski Island is harder to ascertain. Bedforms to the east of Zavodovski originate from headwalls and are confined within gullies suggesting a landslide origin (Type 2 in Table 1). However, the bedform shape changes with distance offshore from concave to convex in some locations. Moreover, shallow seismic data also shows a veneer of downslope prograding sediments containing internal reflectors, suggesting downslope movement of sediment by density flows (Leat et al., 2010). Overbank sediment deposits have also been identified (Leat et al., 2010). The observed bedforms could therefore be interpreted as a consequence of initial mass-wasting (landslide) events followed by eruption-fed density flows thus exhibiting both Type 1 and Type 2 features (Table 1).\nThese examples demonstrate that it is possible to use the general criteria set out in Table 1 as a means to make initial assessment of the processes resulting in different volcanic island flank morphologies. However, the complexity shown offshore Zavodovski Island indicates that caution is required in terms of prescribing specific formation processes in these locations without suitably detailed seismic data in addition to high resolution bathymetric data.\n5.2. Comparison between submarine and subaerial volcanic bedforms # There are strong differences in morphology of volcanic bedforms between subaerial and submarine domains. These morphological discrepancies between subaerial and submarine deposits reflect the different hydrodynamic properties of these flows, subject to the density of the interstitial fluid (gas against water). Another influencing factor may be the slope morphology, coarseness and composition of the substrate.\n5.2.1. Bedforms from eruption-fed density flows # Pyroclastic density currents produced by subaerial volcanism create deposits that range from massive, to non to poorly-stratified deposits (Sparks, 1976), and to deposits recording more dilute conditions, forming sets of dunes and anti-dunes (Sigurdsson et al., 1987, Brown and Branney, 2004). However, subaerial-deposited bedforms do not match the size and extent of the submarine bedforms presented in this study. Dilute pyroclastic density current deposits have bedform heights of \u0026lt;5–10 m and wavelengths reaching several hundred meters (Brown and Branney, 2004). In contrast, the submarine bedforms described here have heights of 10–150 m, and wavelengths can be up to 1700 m and are therefore at least one order of magnitude greater. Dunes formed by dilute pyroclastic density currents can extend across areas up to ∼150 km2 (Sigurdsson et al., 1987), but can be much more localised (Brown and Branney, 2004), and much less extensive than the studied submarine bedforms (\u0026gt;400 km \\(^2\\) ).\nLarge-magnitude silicic eruptions (i.e. Plinian in the subaerial realm) produce high-flux, sustained pyroclastic density currents that can last hours to days (Wolfe and Hoblitt, 1996, Maeno and Imamura, 2011). Under such conditions, voluminous sediment input in the ocean may be continuous for long periods of time, favouring instalment of prolonged sedimentation conditions on the seafloor. This eruptive behaviour is in strong contrast with instantaneous, essentially mass-wasting events such as collapse of an active lava dome or sector collapse (Voight et al., 2002; Trofimovs et al., 2006, Trofimovs et al., 2008), which are associated with gravitational instabilities or vulcanian explosions. Moreover, volumes of transported sediment through lava dome collapses are commonly less voluminous. It is therefore difficult to use literature examples of such collapses to infer hydrodynamic properties in sustained volcaniclastic density flows. Offshore Montserrat, the density flow deposits derived from dome and sector collapses lack bedforms, which we interpret as resulting from rapid accumulation of sediment from short-lived, non-sustained events (Trofimovs et al., 2006, Trofimovs et al., 2008).\nHere, we propose that eruption-fed density flows produce larger and more extensive bedforms in submarine slope settings for the following reasons. First, submarine density flows have smaller density contrasts between their interstitial fluid (seawater) and the transported sediment than for subaerial pyroclastic density currents (air and magmatic gases). This low density contrast in submarine density flows favours supercritical flows (Kostic and Parker, 2006, Cartigny et al., 2014). Moreover, this implies that submarine density flows are slower than their subaerial equivalent, and respond more slowly to changes in slope, such as on the stoss and lee slopes of bedforms (Gray et al., 2006). Such hydrodynamic characteristics lead to formation of larger and more extensive bedforms on underwater slopes (Gray et al., 2006). The small density contrast between particles and seawater also induces slower settling rates of grains (Cashman and Fiske, 1991, Jutzeler et al., 2015), which favours suspension and longer runouts, and hence more extensive bedform fields.\nSecond, bedform development is strongly affected by the concentration of particles within the lowermost part of the flow. For example, pyroclastic block-and-ash flows (formed by collapse of an active lava dome) often contain a dense granular layer at their base, which is typically confined within topography; it is overlain by dilute pyroclastic density currents (surges) that can travel much further (Calder et al., 1999). Sediment settles more rapidly in air than in water, and this favours the generation of dense near-bed flows on land (Breard et al., 2016) rather than underwater (Sohn, 1997). Bedforms produced by such stratified flows are significantly shorter (Cartigny et al., 2014, Postma and Cartigny, 2014, Symons et al., 2016). Future modelling is necessary to test how these various factors may combine to favour bedform generation in submarine settings.\n5.2.2. Bedforms associated with volcanic landslides # Sector collapse of a volcano triggers debris avalanches, which can form hummocks and Toreva blocks in their deposits (e.g. Crandell et al., 1984), but their morphology differ from results of this study. The Type 2 bedforms (Table 1) that we ascribe as most likely originating from landslides (Fig. 6, Fig. 7) differ markedly from the hummocky terrain typically associated with subaerial debris avalanches. Submarine landslide hummocks are chaotic and tend to lack elongate crests; they are not so regularly distributed as the submarine bedforms described here (Watt et al., 2015). Debris avalanches can produce rotated Toreva blocks with linear crests (e.g. Clavero et al., 2002); however, the regular spacing and linear crests of the Type 2 submarine bedforms more closely resembles the morphology of non-volcanic submarine landslides, such as the Eureka Slump offshore Alaska or the Storegga Slide offshore Norway (e.g. Hampton et al., 1996, Micallef et al., 2008). Submarine linear crests are created in response to normal faulting by extension along a seafloor-parallel detachment surface, which produces rows of tilted fault blocks (e.g. Micallef et al., 2008). It records situations in which the failed material does not disintegrate fully, and where marine sediment provides extensive weak layers for regional detachment. The submarine landslide morphology discussed also differs from many previously described submarine landslide, such as deeper-seated and larger failures offshore from the Canary Islands (Masson et al., 2006) in which the landslide material has more fully disintegrated.\n6. Conclusions # Here, we present two detailed marine geophysical datasets from Macauley and Raoul Islands in the Kermadec Arc, which include detailed seismic sub-seafloor profiles through bedforms. Some bedform fields result from eruption-fed submarine density flows. These eruption-fed bedforms are radially extensive around a caldera structure, and seismic profiles show that bedforms migrated up-slope. However, other types of bedform represent rotated blocks in submarine landslides. We therefore propose a series of generally applicable criteria for distinguishing bedforms formed by eruption-fed density flows and landslides (Table 1). As in non-volcanic settings, it may be necessary to collect and analyse detailed seismic data to avoid ambiguity.\nSubmarine density flows derived from sustained silicic explosive eruptions produce larger and more extensive bedforms than pyroclastic density currents, their subaerial equivalent. This is mainly due to the lower density difference between the transported sediment and the interstitial fluid. Relatively slow settling of sediment in water favours formation of bedforms, whereas fast settling of pyroclastic density currents in air favour formation of dense basal layers and flow stratification. Moreover, the reduced density difference causes a slower response of submarine flows to changes in seafloor gradients generating large and extensive bedforms. Bedform occurrence and geometry suggests that the dynamics of submarine and subaerial mass flows are markedly different.\nAcknowledgments # We would like to thank the New Zealand National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA), Dr. Gary Hoffman, Dr. Eli Silver and Dr. Phil Leat for providing access to the fantastic datasets presented as part of this study.

This article introduces the Preservation and Renovation Project of Zhongshan Road in Hangzhou regarding its guiding principles, design concepts, and the entire construction process. In this project, the existing historical buildings along Zhongshan Road were preserved by keeping the remains of different his- torical periods and various lifestyles of the inhabitants. Rather than merely refurbishing the street front only, we reconstructed the Southern Song Dynasty city–block walls along Zhongshan Road and restored the Fangxiang city fabric to create the streetscape of the former Imperial Avenue. Afforested terraced teahouses were built along the road, and the original water system was restored so as to realise the atmosphere of ‘watertown’. New buildings were added by adopting local materials and vernacular building forms. The article summarises two strategies for the preservation of a historic district in a large city. One is the comprehensive project planning by research and inves- tigation. The other is the overall design guideline for the street blocks. It also reflects on the disappointing aspects that mainly resulted from time limitations and the poor taste in the refurbishment of shop houses.\nKEYWORDS Hangzhou, the Southern Song Dynasty Imperial Avenue, redesign of historical district, urban renewal, revival of city culture\nThe Preservation and Renovation Project of Zhong- shan Road is probably the most challenging preservation project during the past 30 years in Hangzhou. Zhongshan Road used to be the Imperial Avenue of the Southern Song Dynasty’s capital city Lin’an, marking the North– South central axis of the city. With the commercial centre moving towards the West Lake districts, Zhongshan Road has been falling into decay during the last few decades. The condition of Zhongshan Road is not a sole case, but a representative example in many Chinese cities, which re- veals the profound contradiction between the preservation of the historic city and urban development. Besides the shift of the city commercial centre, lack of maintenance even worsens the situation because it is thought that the historic districts and buildings will be abandoned sooner or later.\nThis preservation and renovation project is particularly difficult because Zhongshan Road has been experiencing a dynamic development process rather than simply be- ing a static historic area. According to the field survey, the area is composed of nearly half new buildings and half old\n50\nbuildings. The remaining old part is of great importance to the city as nearly 90 percent of the historic buildings in Hangzhou have been demolished since the opening and reform in the 1980s, leaving Zhongshan Road area as the biggest and most important remaining historic area among those remain. On the other hand, the remaining old buildings were neither in good condition at that time nor well preserved. Some local authorities even defined them as ‘a pile of shabby houses’ (Figure 1).\nAlthough Zhongshan Road is also called ‘Imperial Av- enue of the Southern Song Dynasty’, nothing from the Southern Song Dynasty has remained. The only historic artefacts in this area are the traditional dwellings and commercial buildings built in the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic era, and the Western–style shop houses refurbished in the 1920s to meet the visit of Dr Sun Yat- sen. The selection of a historic architectural style was sub- ject of considerable debates before the implementation of the project, as the unification of the streetscape with any single style would destroy the rich historical remains in this area. Should the project only inherits one of the\nBUIILT HERITAGE 2017 / 1\nhistoric styles, the other ones would be damaged. There- fore, how to deal with this complex and mixed historic ur- ban fabric has become the core issue in this project.\nFigure 1 Zhongshan Road before the renovation project 1 (Source: the author).\nAs for the living condition, there are still a large num- ber of residents living in this district. Many of them are elderly people, children, and migrant labourers. The qual- ity of the houses and the residents’ living conditions is not satisfactory from the first glance. After sufficient com- munication with the local government, we obtained two common views on how to deal with the historical assets in the Zhongshan Road area.\nFirstly, although this area could be deemed as ‘a pile of shabby houses’, it is one of the few only historic urban dis- tricts left in Hangzhou. Therefore, the urban fabric of this area shall be restored as an entity.\nSecondly, current living conditions could not be seen solely as negative elements, since the area also has many positive aspects such as the sense of community and tradi- tional living atmosphere which could not be found in the new urban areas of Hangzhou. The fact that local residents live with contentment indicates that such built environ- ment probably is particularly suitable for living. Actually it is an important topic for Hangzhou, since the city is facing the issue of ageing population. Therefore, the main principle of this project is to keep the authenticity of the place, which means that the alterations and additions to the historical buildings made in different time periods and by different groups of people shall all be preserved.\nWe then proposed three principles for the project. The first one is preserving the historical authenticity. Secondly, avoiding forced relocation due to our contention that the traditional living atmosphere and its vitality are all origi- nated the local people. Based on this principle, the policy developed by the local government is called ‘encouraging voluntary relocation, allowing self–refurbishing’. The third principle is to avoid historic falsification, regardless it is Chinese style or Western style.\nBased on the three principles, I proposed the design concept which I would call it ‘city revival’ meaning not simply the preservation of the physical environment of the street. Despite its poor condition, the street has the most traditional living atmosphere of the city which indicates that this place also has enormous cultural value guarding the soul of the city. On the contrary, the newly built areas in Hangzhou with wider roads and building setbacks are similar to the suburbs in the Western world, where street vitality completely lost. From this aspect, the project of Zhongshan Road could be seen as a showcase to show the public how a vibrant urban place should look like. On this account, this project is more than just urban heritage con- servation, but proper city revival. This concept is highly appreciated by the local authority and the initial idea of transformation has been upgraded to ‘city revival’. In ac- cordance to such theme, the most important thing is to keep the walkable street system and small–scale buildings alongside so as to preserve the lively urban atmosphere. Since 1927, the standard width of Zhongshan Road was established in 12 m, but some sections had been widened to 24 m according to the local plan. According to the site visit, those buildings along the street built in the last two\nS. Wang 51\ndecades comply with the new setback building regula- tions, while those old houses still situated along the street lack any setback. Therefore, Zhongshan Road was partially widened, while other parts were still relatively narrow. We decided that a row of two–storey new buildings would be added alongside the widened parts to keep the walkable 12–metre road width. This proposal of narrowing a road instead of widening it is unprecedented in the modern history of Chinese cities.\n2a Figure 2 Intervention on the block wall and the street (Source: the author).\nOur design strategy concerning architecture is ‘coex- istence of the old and the new, and harmony in diversity’. ‘Coexistence of the old and the new’ means the existing historical buildings along Zhongshan Road should be pre- served by keeping the remains of different time periods and various lifestyles of the inhabitants rather than by re- storing to the so-called ‘original’ architectural style. Fur- thermore, the project team decided to preserve also some illegal buildings which were deemed to properly fit the built environment. The conservation of the historic dis- trict cannot solely rely on the preservation of the old mat- ter, otherwise the historic district would result in a static situation without life. Therefore, new original Chinese local architecture should be an important element for the conservation work as a catalyst to stimulate the develop- ment of the historic district. Such new buildings should be added by adopting local materials and identical vernacular building forms to integrate the spirit of local architecture. Another important principle for the buildings is that the new creation could be done based on the historic back- ground, but fake antiques in either western or traditional Chinese style would not allowed in Zhongshan Road pro- ject. Fortunately, all the stakeholders involved in this pro- ject reached consensus on this issue, which indicated that the perception on urban conservation and development has been changing in the last five years.\n52 2b\nThe project also has several other important tasks es- pecially about sorting the historic problems out and rede- sign.\nThe first strategy is to renovate the entire street block rather than simply refurbishing the street fronts. When local authorities approached the project team at the initial stage, the original idea was to refurbish the street front in a relatively short time span, which is common practice in many Chinese cities. Regarding to this request, the project team argued that good urban places have their depth, and that small alleys and yards along the major streets should also be taken into consideration in the renovation project. This idea is called ‘in-depth renovation’ by the project team and actually the refurbishment of the street front is just the superficial part of this idea. This in-depth renova- tion has largely increased not only the workload, but also implied difficulties and raised economic cost. Considering such disadvantages, a normal design institute probably will not choose this approach in the real practice. Howev- er, with an academic background from the iniversity, the team insisted in adopting such approach even it was more difficult to ensure a better result.\nCompared to decorative elements such as building façades, the restoration of the traditional urban fabric raises higher concerns. Therefore, the second strategy is to restore the streetscape of the former Imperial Avenue by reconstructing the city–block walls according to the Southern Song Dynasty fangxiang (literally means block and alleyway) system. Such fangxiang system is an impor- tant part of the character of Hangzhou historic city and largely exemplified the local identity. It has been always in the history of the city and even today local people can rec- ognise fang as a certain place in the city such as Qinghe- fang and Sanyuan-fang. Therefore, the reconstruction of the city block wall, as a significant symbol of fang, was\nBUIILT HERITAGE 2017 / 1\ndeemed necessary (Figure 2). Although it arouse some controversies during the construction, the rebuilding of the city–block walls was appreciated as a creative ap- proach and achieved a good result in creating an enclosed atmosphere in the block without high expenditure.\nFigure 3 Sketch of buildings along the street (Drawn by the 3 author).\nAnother important part of this project is the original design reinterpreting the traditional local architectural features (Figure 3, Figure 4). The project team a variety of new buildings based on this idea, serving as open land- scaped tearooms. However, the local authorities showed little understanding for this feature. Once the design con- cept of recalling the traditional city image was outlined, the key question was how to integrate those traditional elements from the local landscape into the streetscape. Therefore, the project team decided to work on the most distinctive elements, water and mountain, because water is a common urban feature shared by cities in the south- ern Yangtze River region and the mountain is a unique el- ement of Hangzhou, infrequent in the cities in this region. The reconstruction of the water network was essential to recall the traditional watertown image. However, this re- construction has been contested by the experts and local residents because there was no watercourse along with this street in history. In fact, according to some histori- cal archives there used to be two narrow ditches called Taiping-gou (literally ditches for peace) along the street for fire prevention purposes. The middle portion of this street used to be fenced and reserved exclusively for the\nemperor as it also called imperial Avenue of the Southern Song Dynasty, while normal people just walked under the long veranda along the ditches. This is the classic image of this street in the ancient times. Thus, the construction of the watercourse is based on the idea of Taiping-gou to- gether with the typical practice of watercourse construc- tion in this region. Taking advantage of the existing topol- ogy which is lowered from Wushan Mountain to the West Lake Avenue, the water is able to flow naturally through the street without the help of mechanical infrastructures. One of the requests from local authorities was to allow the pedestrians to hear the sound of the water flowing while walking along the street. This aspect has been achieved by this project, especially in the section of Hengfang Street. The watertown atmosphere has been brought back to this area thanks to the flow of the water (Figure 5). The tradi- tional elements from the mountain landscape have been reinterpreted and applied to the design of new buildings along the Zhongshan Road. For instance, the style of the masonry in the newly designed open landscaped tearooms were inspired by the Wushan Mountain. The open land- scaped tearooms are also typical in Southern Song Dy- nasty culture. In addition, this tearoom also imitated the shape of the giant Taihu Lake Stone which is commonly seen in the Southern Song Dynasty’s architecture and landscape painting. Unlike the small Taihu Lake Stone in Classic Suzhou Gardens, the Taihu Lake Stone in Hang- zhou normally has a much larger volume and they still can\nS. Wang 53\nbe seen on the Fenghuang Mountain near Hangzhou. By using the Southern Song Dynasty cultural elements and reinterpreting the landscape, the traditional city image has been, at least partially, brought back to this area. Due to the complicated situation of the street, different elements from different periods have been applied in this project, creating a built environment composed by different styles rather than a uniform appearance which is a high creative approach.\nFigure 4 Small buildings along the street after completion (Source: the author).\nFigure 5 Reconstruction of the water network (Source: the author).\nThe design also found inspiration in the natural and cultural heritage of Hangzhou, including the landscape of Wushan Mountain, the design of Zhonghe waterway, the elements from the Southern Song Dynasty paintings, com- bined with our previous experience mixing the vernacular architectural style with principles of contemporary design. Old buildings were well preserved, while new buildings were carefully added in a renovated but harmonious way (Figure 6). This complied with the ad hoc doctrines of the China Academy of Arts, and was representative of local and international trends of innovation of local architec- ture. From this point of view, we consider the preservation and renovation process achieved a satisfactory result. This has been the first time for the China Academy of Arts to intervene in the large scale of city development. The project offers a valuable experience for the preser- vation of historic districts both for Hangzhou as well as for other large cities in China. One is the comprehensive project planning based in research and investigation. Among all the urban regeneration projects of similar scale 54 developed in Hangzhou city, the preservation and renova- tion project of Zhongshan Road is the first one to incorpo- rate a long phase of research and planning at initial stage. It has emphasised how all the historic and living traces must not be simplified and erased by the so-called ‘design concept and style’. The local authorities argued the choice of our proposal for its in-depth insight, academic spirit and feasible plan. The other reason was the overall design guideline for the street blocks. To guarantee the quality of the project and strictly apply the principle of ‘coexistence of the old and the new, and harmony in diversity’ the de- sign team also implemented innovations from the original prerequisites. For example, instead of including whole length of Zhongshan Road (6 km in total) into this project as it was originally requested by the local authorities at the beginning, the project team made a detailed plan for only one portion of Zhongshan Road (1km) as a showcase and developed design guidelines for the rest (Figure 7). Us- ing such guidelines to control the master plan and design has been a historical achievement in the development of Hangzhou city. Our team also gained experience in the avoidance of forced relocations during the construction process push- ing forward the building implementation in an efficient way. This was quite challenging and some problems en- countered during the project were far beyond expectation. For example, almost no historic information about the old buildings along Zhongshan was available in any city archive, and also information about more recent buildings BUIILT HERITAGE 2017 / 1 45\n67 8a 8b\n8c was partial. It brought huge difficulties to the renovation project and therefore the project team had to conduct the mapping and survey from scratch. As a consequence of avoiding forced relocation, some local residents were willing to move, while others insisted to stay. Therefore, the construction schedule had to be modified for several times according to the relocation process. Should the local government promote future initiatives with high quality standards, it will probably face a similar situation. In this case, we hope that the Zhongshan Road project will be considered a useful test site. (Figure 8).\nFigure 6 Mixture of the old and the new buildings (Source: the author).\nFigure 7 North entrance of the pedestrian street (Source: the author).\nFigure 8a A portion of Zhongshan Road before the renewal project (Source: the author).\nFigure 8b The design sketch for Zhongshan Road renewal project (Source: the author).\nFigure 8c Zhongshan Road after the completion of project (Source: the author).\nAn overall evaluation of the project reveals several hardships as well. Firstly, the project was undertaken too fast leaving negative impact on the historic buildings along the street. Although the team managed to keep the old buildings in different styles, they were all almost re- painted against our original design concept. This proves better than demolishing the old and building fake an- tiques, but still cannot be considered a successful prac- tice. The second problem refers to the lack of effective city management after the completion of the project, which was prevented from achieving the expected outcome. For instance, disharmonious flowerpots were installed along the street two days after the project was completed, although they do not fit into the environment. Another example of ineffective management is that many shop S. Wang 55\nowners refurbished and decorated their shops just accord- ing to their own taste, without considering the surround- ings. On the other hand, it also revealed that the aesthetic perception of the general public still lags behind. These two examples show that once the quality of a place has been upgraded, how to maintain such quality is an essen- tial task for city management. The limited design and con- struction time also contributed to the referred unsatisfac- tory condition. In conclusion, architecture plays a major role in the formation of a beautiful city, and to the same extent, vul- gar architecture in the city will affect its people and make them become vulgar as well. From this perspective about Hangzhou, there are five important aspects upon which we may evaluate its aesthetics. The first is the distinctive character of a city which, makes it different from other cities and cannot be simply judged by one single standard. Second is the general condition of the buildings in the city. Third is the quality and diversity of the city’s lifestyle. The fourth are the rich layers of culture accumulated in the history of the city. Last but not the least, is the readiness of a city to assume change. In sum, these five aspects could conform the criteria upon which to define a city’s cultural creativity. Despite the difficulties, we consider that the Zhongshan Road renovation project is successful and unique, as it gives a response to the five conditions referred above.

It is thought that gills evolved independently in cyclostomes (jawless vertebrates—lampreys and hagfish) and gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates—cartilaginous and bony fishes), based on their distinct embryonic origins: the gills of cyclostomes derive from endoderm [9, 10, 11, 12], while gnathostome gills were classically thought to derive from ectoderm [10, 13]. Here, we demonstrate by cell lineage tracing that the gills of a cartilaginous fish, the little skate (Leucoraja erinacea), are in fact endodermally derived. This finding supports the homology of gills in cyclostomes and gnathostomes, and a single origin of pharyngeal gills prior to the divergence of these two ancient vertebrate lineages.\nPrevious article in issueNext article in issue\nKeywords # gillschondrichthyanskateevolutionvertebratepharyngeal archendodermdevelopmenthomology\nResults and Discussion # Pharyngeal gills are a defining feature of vertebrate animals and are present as vestiges in our own embryology. However, it has been proposed that the gills of cyclostomes and gnathostomes evolved independently. This “ecto-endobranchiate hypothesis” (Figure 1) extends from the observation that the gills of cyclostomes and gnathostomes form on different regions of the branchial arches (medial versus lateral to the gill endoskeleton, respectively) and arise from distinct embryonic epithelia (endodermal versus ectodermal, respectively) [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. While the topological incongruence of gills and their skeletal support is not generally regarded as an insurmountable obstacle to homology [7, 8, 14], the issue of distinct embryonic origins is potentially more problematic and remains unresolved.\nGillis \u0026amp; Tidswell, 2017, Current Biology 27, 729–732 March 6, 2017 a 2017 The Authors.

The Ecto-endobranchiate Hypothesis The independent evolution of gills in cyclostomes and gnathostomes (from a gill-less common ancestor), based on their distinct embryonic origins from endoderm and ectoderm, respectively. Redrawn after Jarvik [3] and Jollie [5].\nIn fishes, gills develop on pharyngeal arches, paired columns of tissue that are bound by ectodermal and endodermal epithelia and form from the walls of the embryonic foregut [15]. Pharyngeal arch development begins with the iterative outpocketing of foregut endoderm in a rostral-to-caudal sequence, giving rise to a series of endodermal pouches [16]. These pouches subsequently contact and fuse with overlying surface ectoderm, resulting in the perforation of gill slits and the delineation of arches (Figure 2A). The endodermal origin of gills in lamprey and hagfish is well established from classical histological studies [9–12], but the putative ectodermal origin of gills in bony fishes is less well documented. Goette described the early development of gills in sturgeon and noted that gill filaments arise from pharyngeal ectoderm, appearing first on the outside of the pharynx, prior to perforation of the gill slits [10]. Kellicott also proposed an ectodermal origin of the gills in lungfish, noting an inward migration of ectodermal epithelium following gill slit perforation but prior to gill filament differentiation [13]. However, cell lineage tracing experiments have demonstrated an endodermal origin of gills in zebrafish [17]. Thus, it remains unclear whether the gills of bony fishes primitively developed from endoderm or ectoderm. We therefore sought to investigate the embryonic origin of the gills in a cartilaginous fish, the little skate, Leucoraja erinacea—an outgroup to the bony fishes, which may permit the inference of primitive anatomical and developmental conditions in the last common ancestor of jawed vertebrates.\nDownload : Download high-res image (1MB)Download : Download full-size image\nFigure 2. Skate Gill Filaments Arise within an Endodermal Shh Expression Domain (A) At stage 22, the sequence of pharyngeal arch formation may be captured along the rostro-caudal axis of a single embryo (rostral to the left). Endodermally derived pharyngeal pouches (pp) contact surface ectoderm and ultimately fuse with this ectoderm (black arrow), giving rise to a gill slit (gs). The columns of tissue that are isolated by adjacent gill slits are pharyngeal arches (pharyngeal arches 3, 4, and 5 shown here).\n(B) Shh is expressed along the anterior wall of each pharyngeal pouch (pp) and, eventually, along the posterior wall of each pharyngeal arch (pharyngeal arches 2, 3, 4, and 5 shown here). The red dashed line at the interface between Shh-expressing and non-expressing epithelia indicates the predicted interface between endoderm (en) and ectoderm (ec). Note that early gill filaments (gf) arise within Shh-expressing epithelium. The black dashed lines delineate caudal pharyngeal pouch endoderm, and the black arrow indicates a pharyngeal pouch fusing with overlaying surface ectoderm.\n(C) Schematic illustrating predicted tissue contributions to skate pharyngeal arches. Based on histological and gene expression analyses, we predict that gill filaments (gf) derive from endodermal epithelium.\nScale bars represent 40 μm.\nIn the stage 22 (S22) skate embryo [18], the gene encoding the developmental signaling molecule Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is expressed in the anterior endodermal domain of each developing pharyngeal pouch. Once the pouches have fused with the overlying ectoderm, this Shh expression domain comprises the posterior epithelium of each pharyngeal arch, where it functions to establish the anterior-posterior axis of the arch [19]. We have noted that the first gill buds, which differentiate from pharyngeal arch epithelium shortly after gill slit perforation, form within this Shh expression domain (Figure 2B). Given the endodermal origin of this Shh expression domain, this suggests that these gill buds are endodermally derived (Figure 2C), though we cannot rule out that the pharyngeal Shh expression domain expands to include adjacent pharyngeal ectoderm upon gill slit perforation.\nTo directly test the embryonic origin of the gills in skate, we conducted a series of pharyngeal endodermal fate mapping experiments. We microinjected the lipophilic dye CM-DiI into the pharyngeal cavity of skate embryos at S18 (prior to the perforation of gill slits) (Figure 3A), and histological examination of labeled embryos 1 day post injection (dpi) (n = 3) revealed that this strategy allows us to focally label regions of pharyngeal endoderm without contaminating overlying ectoderm (Figure 3B). An analysis of labeled embryos at S22 (∼4–7 dpi; n = 3) allowed us to visualize the endodermal contributions to the pharyngeal arches immediately prior to (Figure 3C) and following (Figure 3D) gill slit perforation. Upon their initial delineation by adjacent gill slits, approximately 3/4 of the epithelium surrounding a pharyngeal arch derives from endoderm, with only the lateralmost 1/4 deriving from ectoderm. By S27/28, differentiated gill filaments are present on the hyoid and gill arches. Elasmobranch embryos possess both internal and transient external gill filaments, with the latter ultimately resorbing and remodeling into internal filaments [20]. In labeled embryos reared to S27/28 (∼40–50 dpi; n = 7), CM-DiI-positive external gill filaments were readily apparent (Figure 3E), while histological analyses revealed CM-DiI-positive epithelium on both the external (Figure 3F) and internal gill filaments (Figures 3G and 3H). These experiments, which allow us to directly trace derivatives of pharyngeal endodermal epithelium, demonstrate the endodermal origin of gills in the little skate.\nDownload : Download high-res image (1MB)Download : Download full-size image\nFigure 3.

Gill structures are preserved in the stem vertebrates Myllogkunmingia [24], Metaspriggina [25], and Haikouichthys [26], but in the absence of consensus regarding the homology of gills within the crown group, it has remained unclear to what extent these structures may inform the nature of gills in the last common ancestor of vertebrates. Our demonstration of an endodermal origin of gills in a cartilaginous fish bolsters the homology of gills in cyclostomes and gnathostomes, and the single origin of pharyngeal gills prior to the divergence of these two ancient vertebrate lineages. Our findings, along with recent phylogenetic [27] and paleontological [25] advances, contribute to an emerging picture in which the crown ancestor of vertebrates was more complex—and exhibited more gnathostome-like anatomical conditions—than was previously appreciated, and are consistent with scenarios in which gills evolved along the vertebrate stem, in conjunction with a more active lifestyle [1].\nExperimental Procedures # Embryo Collection # L. erinacea eggs were obtained at the Marine Biological Laboratory (Woods Hole, Massachusetts, USA) and maintained in a flow-through seawater system at ∼17°C to the desired developmental stage. Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4°C, rinsed three times in PBS, dehydrated into 100% methanol, and stored at −20°C. All animal work complied with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Marine Biological Laboratory.\nHistology and mRNA In Situ Hybridization # For histological analysis, embryos were embedded in paraffin wax and sectioned at 7 μm as previously described [28]. Sections of CM-DiI-labeled embryos were rehydrated and coverslipped with Fluoromount G containing DAPI (Southern Biotech). Sections were subsequently decoverslipped in water and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. In situ hybridization experiments for L. erinacea Shh (GenBank: EF100667) were performed on paraffin sections as previously described [28].\nFate Mapping # For CM-DiI fate mapping experiments, eggs containing embryos at S18 were windowed, and CellTracker CM-DiI (ThermoFisher Scientific; 0.5 μg/μL, prepared by diluting a 5 μg/μL ethanol stock 1:10 in 0.3M sucrose) was microinjected into the pharyngeal cavity using a pulled glass capillary needle and a Picospritzer pressure injector. Eggs were then sealed with a piece of donor eggshell and Krazy Glue and were left to develop in a flow-through seawater table for 1–50 days prior to fixation.\nAuthor Contributions # J.A.G. conceived the study and conducted and analyzed the cell lineage tracing experiments.

The tsunami caused about 2,000 casualties along the Hokkaido and northern Honsu coasts and inflicted damage as far as the Korean Peninsula. The tsunami source is located between recent tsunamigenic earthquakes, but there is no historical record of an earthquake in 1741. In contrast, the records indicate volcanic activity of Oshima-Oshima, including a large-scale sector collapse, although the volume change associated with the subaerial landslide is too small to explain the observed tsunami heights. Recent marine surveys indicate that the landslide extended to the ocean bottom with a volume change of about 2.5 km3, nearly an order of magnitude larger than the subaerial slide. On the basis of mapped bathymetry, the generation of the tsunami is calculated using a simple kinematic landslide model. The tsunami propagation is computed in two different grids—a 6″ grid around the source and a 1′ grid for the entire Japan Sea. A parameter search of the model shows that the observed tsunami heights are best explained by a horizontal slide velocity of 40 m/s and a rise time of 2 min. The large vertical drop of the landslide and the coupling of the submarine landslide and tsunami are the main factors responsible for the large tsunami.\nhttps://earth-planets-space.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/BF03352698#rightslink\nPage 1 of 13 1. Introduction # In 1741, a very destructive tsunami originated some- where in the area around Oshima-Oshima, a small volcanic island off Hokkaido that had become active that same year, causing significant damage on the coasts around the Japan Sea (Fig. 1). On the Hokkaido coast, the estimated maxi- mum tsunami height was 13 m or more, and total casualties amounted to about 2,000 (Hatori, 1984; Imamura and Mat- sumoto, 1998; Tsuji et al., 2002). The tsunami inflicted material damage as far as western Japan and the east coast of the Korean Peninsula (Tsuji et al., 1985). Based on the recorded heights of the tsunami, if it were to have been gen- erated by an earthquake, its size would be M=8.4 (Abe, 1999). However, there is no historical record document- ing the ground motion of an earthquake of this magnitude, even though the eruption sequences and the tsunami dam- age were documented in detail. The generation mechanism of the 1741 tsunami continues to be open to debate and has yet to be definitively determined despite its importance for assessing volcanic hazard and/or seismic potential along the eastern margin of the Japan Sea.\nThe eastern margin of the Japan Sea is considered to be a boundary between the Eurasian (or Amurean) and North American (or Okhotsk) plates (e.g., Nakamura, 1983; Seno et al., 1996; Wei and Seno, 1998), where large (M\u0026gt;7.5) tsunamigenic earthquakes have occurred semi-periodically (Fig. 1). In the last two centuries, the 1833 Shonai- oki ( M =7 \\(\\frac 1 2\\) ), 1940 Shakotan-oki ( M =7.5), 1964 Niigata ( M =7.5), 1983 Japan Sea ( M =7.7), and 1993 Southwest Hokkaido ( M =7.8) earthquakes have occurred on this tec- tonic boundary (Fukao and Furumoto, 1975; Satake, 1986; Tanioka et al., 1995). The sections of the boundary between these earthquake sources may form seismic gaps. One of these lies around Oshima-Oshima between the 1983 Japan Sea and 1993 Southwest Hokkaido earthquakes. Ohtake (1995) assumed that the 1741 tsunami was produced by an earthquake that was the first in the current earthquake cy- cle and forecasted that the next earthquake would occur be- tween the source regions of the 1833 Shonai-oki and 1983 Japan Sea events. His assumption and subsequent forecast may become invalid if the 1741 tsunami was not generated by an earthquake.\nCopyright ⃝c The Society of Geomagnetism and Earth, Planetary and Space Sci- ences (SGEPSS); The Seismological Society of Japan; The Volcanological Society of Japan; The Geodetic Society of Japan; The Japanese Society for Planetary Sci- ences; TERRAPUB. The Oshima-Oshima volcano has a history of violent eruptions. It was last recorded to be active in 1741–1790, after 1500 years of dormancy (Katsui et al., 1977; Katsui and Yamamoto, 1981). According to historical documents, the first eruption started around August 18, 1741. On Au- gust 23, the volcanic eruption was visible all along the Hokkaido coast and by around noon of August 25, volcanic ashfall blocked the sunlight and the sky became dark dur- ing the day. The most violent eruption occurred around 5 AM hours on August 29 and triggered a sector collapse of the mountain edifice; at which time a loud explosive sound was heard on the Hokkaido coast. Strong eruptions were also recorded several times in the following year (1742), and smoke emission continued until 1790. Frequent mag- matic eruptions in this activity period buried most of the amphitheater and produced a central cone.\nEarth Planets Space, 59, 381–390, 2007 381 382 K. SATAKE: VOLCANIC ORIGIN OF THE 1741 OSHIMA-OSHIMA TSUNAMI IN THE JAPAN SEA Previous modeling of the 1741 tsunami based on a vol- canic eruption was not successful. Aida (1984) performed tsunami numerical computations based on the subaerial col- lapse of the volcano. He assumed that the collapse was en- tirely subaerial and had a volume of 0.4 km3, of which 0.1 km3 flowed into the sea to generate the tsunami. As the cal- culated tsunami heights from this model were much smaller than the actually observed heights, it has been inferred that a large earthquake triggered the collapse and generated the tsunami (e.g., Katsui and Yamamoto, 1981; Hatori, 1994).\nFig. 1. Oshima-Oshima (solid triangle) is located on the boundary be-tween the Eurasian (or Amurean) and North American (or Okhotsk) plates, where large (M \u0026gt;7.5) tsunamigenic earthquakes have occurred since the 19th century. The source area and focal mechanism of the 20th century earthquakes are from Fukao and Furumoto (1975), Satake (1986), and Tanioka et al. (1995).\nDetailed swath bathymetry surveys have been recently conducted around Oshima-Oshima, and a high-resolution bathymetry map has been published by Hydrographic De- partment of the Japan Coast Guard. The map shows the two characteristic features of a volcano collapse landslide: an open sector collapse with steep lateral walls and an area of hummocky terrain on the lower slope of the volcano. The arcuate headwall of the landslide is above sea level on Oshima-Oshima island and is partly buried by the ac- tive summit crater. Geological surveys using submersibles and deep-tow sonar (Kato, 1997) confirmed that the hum- mocky terrain consists of debris deposits from the Oshima- Oshima volcano. Based on the high-resolution bathymetry and topographic data, Satake and Kato (2001) reconstructed the subaerial and submarine sector collapse and debris avalanche of the 1741 eruption and estimated the total vol-ume of the collapse to be 2.4 km3. Based on their calcu- lations, the total volume of debris deposits, which extends as far as 16 km from the island, is 2.5 km3 and roughly equals the missing slide volume. The slide volume is nearly an order of magnitude larger than the previous estimate of subaerial collapse (0.4 km3).\nThe 1741 Oshima-Oshima collapse is one of only two large (volume\u0026gt;1 km3) sector collapses to have occurred at island volcanoes in the periods of historical and written records. The other example is Ritter Island in Papua New Guinea in 1888, where nearly 5 km3 of volcano collapsed (Johnson, 1987; Ward and Day, 2003). The volume change of Oshima-Oshima volcano is similar to that of the 1980 Mt. St. Helens eruption in the USA (2.3 km3; Voight et al., 1981). Both in Ritter Island and Mt. St. Helens, more of the summit of volcano was removed, leaving horseshoe- shaped collapse scars. The size of island and bathymet- ric features around Oshima-Oshima is very similar to those of Stromboli volcano in Italy, where a submarine fan ex- tends more than 10 km offshore from the subaerial collapse sector, Sciara del Fuoco (Kokelaar and Romagnoli, 1995). The recent small-scale landslide (0.02–0.03 km3) in 2002 caused tsunami damage on Stromboli Island (Tinti et al., 2005).\nFig. 2.

In Section 2, the observed tsunami heights in 1741 are com- piled from historical documents and recent field survey re- ports.

Section 5 shows the results that the observed tsunami heights, including those in the western Japan and the Korean coast, can be explained by the landslide source. Section 6 discusses why a submarine or ocean-entering landslide can cause larger tsunamis than earthquakes of comparable rupture areas. Section 7 con- cludes that the generation mechanism of the 1741 tsunami can be explained by the submarine landslide associated with the volcanic eruption.\n384 K.

Observed Tsunami Wave Heights # The 1741 tsunami caused devastating damage along the Hokkaido coast and lesser damage on the Honshu and Ko- rean coasts. More than 30 documents, both original and secondary sources, contain descriptions of the damage that resulted from this tsunami (Tsuji et al., 2002). These doc- uments also describe the eruption and tsunami sequences (Fig. 2), but ground shaking due to an earthquake is not mentioned in any of the documents, although some records do describe a loud sound that accompanied the tsunami. Ha- tori (1984), Imamura and Matsumoto (1998), Tsuji et al. (2002), and Imamura et al. (2002) estimated the tsunami heights by combining the damage described in the docu- ments and/or oral histories passed down from generation to generation with land heights measured by recent field sur- veys. These estimates of tsunami heights have been com- piled (Table 1, Figs. 3 and 4) and are used in this study. Multiple estimates at the same location by different inves- tigators are averaged. Those heights based on oral histo- ries rather than written documents tend to be consistently higher and are considered to be less reliable (Fig. 5). The tidal range in the Japan Sea is small, up to 0.5 m, hence no correction for tide was made.\nFig. 5. Comparison of the observed and computed tsunami heights. Circles indicate the observed tsunami heights; solid circles are based on written documents while open circles are based on less-reliable oral histories. Solid curves are the computed tsunami heights (half of the peak-to-trough amplitude) from the kinematic landslide model (U=40 m/s and T =2 min) on the 6′′ grid, while the crosses show the computed heights (peak-to-trough amplitudes) on the 1′ grid. See Figs. 3 and 4 for the locations.\nAlong the Hokkaido coast, the 1741 tsunami caused the worst natural disaster in the Hokkaido’s history, as de- scribed in many documents. One document, “Fukuyama Hifu”, the official record of local government, reported that the tsunami arrived in the early morning of August 29 and inundated approximately a 120-km length of the coastal ar- eas, causing 1,467 casualties and damaging 791 houses and 1,521 ships. These numbers do not include native residents (Ainu) who occupied the area north of Kumaishi but did not leave any written records (Fig. 4). There is no written record of the tsunami damage on Okushiri Island. Hatori (1984), and Tsuji et al. (2002) estimated that the total casu- alties including Ainu would be more than 2,000.\nK. SATAKE: VOLCANIC ORIGIN OF THE 1741 OSHIMA-OSHIMA TSUNAMI IN THE JAPAN SEA 385 The maximum estimated height based on the oral histo- ries is 34 m at Gankakezawa, while the maximum height based on written records is about 13 m at Era (Table 1, Fig. 5). Conservative estimates of the tsunami height range from 3 to 13 m on the Hokkaido coast. The height distri- bution appears to show two peaks: one in the north around Kumaishi and the other at the southwestern tip of the penin- sula around Era. Between these peaks, the estimated heights around Esashi are smaller. Some documents report that the sea water first receded at Kumaishi and Esashi (Tsuji et al., 2002), although the reliability is somewhat questionable.\nThe tsunami heights on the Honshu coasts were estimated by Hatori (1984) and Imamura et al. (2002). On the Tsug- aru coast, the northern tip of Honshu, more than ten casu- alties and damage to several tens of houses were recorded at Kodomari and Kanegasawa. The tsunami heights at these and other villages were estimated to be between 4 and 6 m (Table 1, Fig. 5). On Sado Island, more than 350 km from Oshima-Oshima, the tsunami heights were estimated to be between 2 and 5 m based on descriptions of the damage, while the oral histories suggest a height of 8 m. Damage from the tsunami was also documented further west at Noto, Obama, and Gohtsu, where the heights were estimated to be 4, 1, and 2 m, respectively.\nDamage from the tsunami was recorded as far as on the east coast of the Korean Peninsula. “Annals of Choson Dy- nasty” recorded tsunami damage along the east coast of Ko- rean Peninsula on the same day http://sillok.history.go.kr/main/main.jsp. Tsuji et al. (1985) estimated that the tsunami heights were 3–4 m along the 320-km long coast. Although the exact locations of the tsunami damage are not clear, this piece of information would provide an important constraint. In accordance with Tsuji et al. (1985), the Ko- rean tsunami was assumed to be highest at Pyonhae, where it reached 4 m; elsewhere along the 320 km-long coast, it was assumed to reach a height of 3 m (Figs. 3 and 5).\n3. Submarine Landslide Models # Tsunamigenic landslides can be classified as slumps and debris avalanches. Slumps are characterized by large blocks moving slowly and coherently, whereas debris avalanches are distinguished by many smaller masses of debris dis- tributed over a larger area, suggesting fast-moving land- slides. The slump source may be modeled by rigid body motion, particularly if the bathymetry change is known. The debris avalanches are more difficult to model; they can be modeled as slides of many rigid bodies or fluid flow. In any case, dynamic parameters, such as slide velocity, are needed.\nFig. 6. Bathymetry after the landslide (contour interval: 25 m) and inferred contours (interval: 50 m) of the thickness of the material removed from the collapse scar (lower shaded region) and added to the landslide de- posit region (upper). The thickness contours and the described volume are used for the tsunami computations. Based on the estimate of Satake and Kato (2001).\nFig. 7. Schematic view of the kinematic landslide model used in this study.\nThe generation of a tsunami from landslides has been modeled in several ways, such as dynamic flow, kinematic rigid-body motion, and static initial profile. In the dynamic fluid flow approach, the landslide is treated as fluid, and its evolution is calculated simultaneously with the propa- gation of the tsunami (Jiang and LeBlond, 1994; Imamura and Imteaz, 1995; Heinrich et al., 1998). Kawamata et al. (2005) recently modeled the 1741 Oshima-Oshima tsunami using a two-layer model and volume change estimated by Satake and Kato (2001). In the rigid-body approach, tem- poral changes in the water height due to the progress of a submarine landslide are prescribed and used for the initial condition of tsunami propagation. Harbitz (1992) used a box-shaped slide, and Ward (2001) used a chain of rigid boxes. Tinti et al. (1997) introduced a block model of land- slide to simulate the landslide motion, then used the results for tsunami computations. In the static approach, an ini- tial water profile due to landslide is assumed. Watts et al. (2005), based on the results of physical and numerical ex- periments, introduced a parametric initial water profile for a submarine landslide and applied such a method to several landslide-generated tsunamis.\nIn this paper, a simple kinematic landslide model is in- troduced (Fig. 7). The volume change as shown in Fig. 6 is used as the initial water height distribution. The initial water height at each point, negative in the slide region and positive in the debris deposit region, is performed during rise time T. This assumption models a rotational slump rather than debris avalanches. To model the slide motion, we assume that the slide front propagates outward from the volcano peak with a horizontal velocity of U. Hence, the landslide motion is characterized by these two parameters, U and T (Fig. 7).\n386 K. SATAKE: VOLCANIC ORIGIN OF THE 1741 OSHIMA-OSHIMA TSUNAMI IN THE JAPAN SEA The kinematic slide model is similar to the kinematic source model of earthquakes known as the Haskell model (e.g., Aki and Richards, 1980), in which rise time and rup- ture duration (fault length divided by rupture velocity) are prescribed to compute seismic waveforms. The only dif- ference between these two models is that the slip on the fault is uniform in the Haskell model, whereas the displace- ment varies in the kinematic landslide model. In the kine- matic slide model, the slide (missing volume) first appears, then the deposit (additional volume) results. During the slide motion, the mass is not conserved. The kinematic landslide model was applied to the Nuuanu and Wailau gi- ant submarine landslides around Hawaii, based on recently mapped detailed bathymetric data (Satake et al., 2002), but the landslide parameters were not calibrated with the ob- served tsunamis.\nThe area and volume of sector collapse associated with the 1741 Oshima-Oshima eruption is estimated to be 17±4 km2 and 2.4±0.3 km3, respectively, by Satake and Kato (2001). They also estimated that the debris deposits ex- tended into an area of 69±4 km2, with a total volume of 2.5±0.3 km3 (Fig. 6). The missing (slide) volume is lo- cated just north of the island, with a maximum thickness of 400±6 m, while the excess (deposit) volume extends as far as 16 km from the island, with an average thickness of 36±2 m. These values are used for the initial condi- tions of tsunami generation and propagation. They do not include thinner deposits of debris or debris avalanche ex- tending over a wider area, as observed around Ritter Island (Silver et al., 2005), but such thinner deposits may not have contributed to the tsunami generation.\nThe computed tsunami heights from various landslide pa- rameters in the kinematic slide model are compared with the observed tsunami heights. The horizontal slide velocity is varied from U=10 m/s to 100 m/s. At the time of the 1980 Mt. St. Helens eruption, the velocity of the first sub- aerial slide is estimated to be 50–70 m/s from the analysis of a series of photographs (Voight, 1981). For the 1888 Ritter Island tsunami, Ward and Day (2003) used an es- timated landslide deposit distribution and showed that the broad features of the observed tsunami could be reproduced using the tsunami model of Ward (2001) with landslide ve- locities of 40 m/s or more. For the Storegga slides, Har- bitz (1992) assigned 20 m/s and 50 m/s for the lower and upper limits of the submarine slide velocity. For the giant Hawaiian landslides, Satake et al. (2002) modeled three dif- ferent velocities—20, 50, and 100 m/s—and found that the tsunami heights from the latter two velocities were equally larger than those from 20 m/s on both Hawaiian Islands and the west coast of North America.\nDuration, or rise time, of bottom deformation at each point is more difficult to estimate. For earthquake tsunamis, Kajiura (1970) concluded that the deformation can be con- sidered to be instantaneous if it is less than several minutes. While a landslide source may be smaller than an earthquake source, three different rise times, T=1, 2, and 5 min, are tested in this study. Because the displacement varies within the source area, the constant rise time implies that the local vertical velocity of bottom deformation also varies.\n4. Tsunami Propagation Modeling # Tsunami propagation is calculated using nonlinear shallow-water equations. The equation of motion is\n\\[\\tag{1} \\frac {∂\\pmb{V}} {∂t} \u0026#43; (\\pmb{V} · ∇)\\pmb{V} = -g∇h - C_f \\frac {\\pmb{V}|\\pmb{V}|} {d\u0026#43;h} \\] where V is the horizontal velocity vector, h is the water (tsunami) height, d is the water depth, and g is the gravi- tational acceleration. The second term on the right of the equation represents the bottom friction where Cf is the non-dimensional friction coefficient. In this study, depth- dependent friction is assumed so that the coefficient is given with the Manning’s roughness coefficient n (assumed to be 0.03 m−1/3 s) as\n\\[ C_f = \\frac {gn^2} {(d\u0026#43;h)^{1/3}}. \\] The equation of continuity is written as\n\\[\\tag{2} \\frac {∂(d\u0026#43;h)} {∂t} = −∇· \\lbrace(d\u0026#43;h)\\pmb{V}\\rbrace. \\] The finite-difference method on a staggered grid system is adopted to numerically solve the above equations. The computations are made on two different grids. One is around the source area (138.5–140.5◦E and 40.5–42.5◦N) with a grid spacing of 6′′ (arc second) or 185 m along the meridian (Fig. 4). The bathymetry data are compiled from JODC (Japan Oceanographic Data Center) data and recent bathymetric surveys (see Satake and Kato, 2001). The num- ber of grid cells is 1200×1200, and the computational time step is 0.5 s to satisfy the stability condition of the finite- difference method. The generation and propagation of the tsunami for 45 min in real time are computed so that the full waveforms at all of the coastal points are obtained. The second grid is for the entire Japan Sea (127–143◦E and 33– 52◦N) with a grid spacing of 1′ (arc minute) or 1,853 m along the meridian (Fig. 3). The bathymetric data are from the JODC database. The number of cells is 960×1140, and the computational time step is 5 s to satisfy the stability con- dition. The generation and propagation of the tsunami for 4 h in real time are computed.\nTsunami heights are computed at coastal points where they can be compared with the observed heights. In gen- eral, computed tsunami heights are smaller on coarser grids because of two factors: the computed water height is an average value for each grid cell, and the water depth on the coastal cell is shallower (e.g., Satake, 1995; Satake and Tanioka, 1995). The computed heights on different girds, the 6′′ and 1′ grids, are first compared on 34 coastal points in Hokkaido and Tsugaru. The average amplitude ratio (for peak-to-trough amplitude) is 0.54, indicating that the computed tsunami heights on the 6′′ grid are about twofold larger than those on the 1′ grid. Therefore, a half of a peak-to-trough amplitude on the 6′′ grid and the peak-to- trough amplitude on the 1′ grid are adopted as the computed tsunami heights. As shown in Fig. 5, these agree very well.\nK. SATAKE: VOLCANIC ORIGIN OF THE 1741 OSHIMA-OSHIMA TSUNAMI IN THE JAPAN SEA 387 Fig. 8. Comparison of the statistical parameters for different sets of horizontal slide velocity U and rise time T. The top row shows those for around the source on the 6′′ grid, while the bottom row is for the entire Japan Sea from both 6′′ and 1′ grids. The left column is the geometric mean of observed and computed amplitudes K. The center column is for the error factor κ. The right column is for linear correlation factor r. The darker color indicates the better fit between the observed and computed heights.\nIn order to carry out a comparison between the observed run-up heights and computed heights on coastal cells, three statistical parameters are introduced. The first is the geo- metric mean K of the amplitude ratio \\({O_i}/{C_i}\\) , where \\({O_i}\\) and \\({C_i}\\) are the observed and computed heights, respectively, at station i. The second is an index of scatter, defined by Aida (1978) as\n\\[\\tag{3} \\log κ = \\Big\\lceil \\frac 1 n \\sum_j \\left( \\log \\frac {O_i} {C_i} \\right) ^2 (\\log K)^2 \\Big\\rceil ^{1/2}. \\] If the logarithmic amplitude ratios obey the normal distri- bution N (log K, log κ), then parameter κ can be considered as an error factor because its logarithm shows the standard deviation. The third parameter is the linear correlation co- efficient\n\\[\\tag{4} r = \\frac {\\sum_i (O_i - \\bar{O})(C_i - \\bar{C})} {\\sqrt{\\sum_i (O_i - \\bar{O})} \\sqrt{\\sum_i (C_i - \\bar{C})}} \\] where \\(\\bar{O})\\) and \\(\\bar{C})\\) are the means of Oi ’s and Ci ’s, respectively. The first parameter, K, indicates the relative size of the observed and computed tsunami models, whereas the latter two indicate the goodness of the model. The smaller κ and the larger r are the measures of the better model.\n5. Tsunami Computation Results # The tsunami generation is computed using the kinematic landslide model, and the propagation is computed for both the 6′′ and 1′ grids. The computations are repeated with different sets of horizontal slide velocity U and rise time T (Table 2). The computed tsunami heights are then compared with the observed ones, and the statistical parameters K, κ and r are calculated. These parameters are calculated for two different regions: the coasts near the source on the 6′′ grid and the entire Japan Sea for which the computed heights are on the 6′′ grid around the source and those are on the 1′ grid for the western Japan and Korean coasts.\nThe amplitude ratio K, the error factor κ and the lin- ear correlation factor r vary with the assumed parameters (Fig. 8). The K values are close to 1 for U=40–80 m/s and T≤2 min. The error factor shows a peak (trough in κ value) at U=40–60 m/s and T=2 min for the 6′′ grid. With the larger peak value (smaller κ value), the peak is shifted to T=5 min for the entire Japan Sea. The linear correlation factor r also shows a peak at U=40–60 m/s and T=2 min for the 6′′ grid. For the entire Japan Sea, the peak is lo- cated at the same place, although the shape is rather broad. From these comparisons, it can be concluded that the kine- matic landslide model with U=40 m/s and T=2 min best explains the observed tsunami heights. For this combina- tion, K=0.99, κ =1.37, and r=0.75 for the near-source re- gion, and K =1.11, κ=1.50, and r=0.84 for the entire Japan Sea.\nFor comparison, Kawamata et al. (2005) also estimated K and κ values for their earthquake fault and two-layer slide models. Their fault model yielded K=0.89 and κ =1.38 for the near-source region, and K=1.00 and κ =1.68 for the en- tire Japan Sea. Their two-layer slide model yielded K=0.99 and κ=1.76 for the near-source region, and K=1.01 and κ=1.58 for the entire Japan Sea. The smaller κ values in the present model indicate that our model shows a better fit with the distribution of the observed tsunami heights.\nThe effects of the kinematic landslide parameters on the coastal tsunami heights are also examined (Fig. 9). For comparison, the observed tsunami heights are also shown. The horizontal slide velocity is first fixed at U=40 m/s and the rise time is varied as T=1, 2, and 5 min (top figure).\n388 K.

Bottom: The rise time T is fixed at 2 min and the horizontal slide velocity varied as U =20, 40, and 100 m/s. Those for U =60 and 80 m/s are similar to the 40 m/s case and are, therefore, not shown.\nK. SATAKE: VOLCANIC ORIGIN OF THE 1741 OSHIMA-OSHIMA TSUNAMI IN THE JAPAN SEA 389 The computed tsunami heights for T=5 min are systemat- ically lower than the other cases or the observations. The computed heights for T=1 min and 2 min are similar, al- though the former has larger narrow peaks. In the next step, the rise time is fixed at T=2 min and the velocity is varied as U=20, 40, and 100 m/s (lower figure). The computed heights for U=40 m/s are similar to the observed heights on the Hokkaido coast. The computed heights for U=20 m/s are lower on the Hokkaido coast, and those from U=100 m/s are also lower on the northern Hokkaido coast. The tsunami heights for U=60 and 80 m/s are similar to those for U=40 m/s and are, therefore, not shown. The com- puted tsunami heights for different slide velocities are sim- ilar on the Tsugaru coast. These comparisons indicate that the tsunami heights on the Hokkaido coasts are more sensi- tive to the slide parameters than those on the Tsuguru coast.\nTsunami waveforms calculated from different parame- ters show different features. Figure 10 shows the computed tsunami waveforms at four selected locations, Kumaishi, Esashi, Era, and Ajigasawa. For the same slide velocity (U=40 m/s), the waveforms and amplitudes are similar for T=1 and 2 min, while that for T=5 min is considerably dif- ferent, with smaller amplitudes. This feature is common to all of the locations regardless of the azimuth. For the same rise time (T=2 min), the faster slide velocity produces the earlier arrival time. At Kumaishi (northeastern azimuth), the amplitude is largest for U=40 m/s. At other locations, the waveforms and amplitudes for U=40–100 m/s are very similar. All of the waveforms start with negative motions, which is consistent with the report that the water initially receded at Kumaishi and Esashi (Tsuji et al., 2002).\n6. Discussion # The 1741 tsunami can be explained by a submarine land- slide associated with the sector collapse of the Oshima- Oshima volcano. While the length of the submarine land- slide is much larger than the volcano (∼4 km), it still reaches only 16 km, which is much smaller than the typ- ical size of tsunamigenic earthquakes (∼100 km). An in- teresting question is why this submarine landslide was able to cause such a large tsunami equivalent to an earthquake of M=8.4 (Abe, 1999). Two factors appear to have con- tributed to the large tsunami: the large vertical drop and the coupling of the landslide and tsunami.\nRuff (2003) examined the energy balance for tsunamis generated from landslides and earthquakes. Using a sim- ple block model, he showed that the tsunami becomes the largest when the ratio of initial water depth above the block to downslope vertical drop of the block is less than 1. In the case of Oshima-Oshima, the slide top is above sea level, hence the water depth is smaller than the vertical drop and the ratio is indeed less than 1. If the slide were to have been limited to a small part of the ocean slope around the island, the tsunami energy would have been smaller.\nFig. 10. Computed tsunami waveforms from different landslide models at Kumaishi, Esashi, Era, and Ajigasawa (see Fig. 4 for the locations). The tsunami heights from the kinematic slide model with parameters (U, T)=(40 m/s, 1 min), (40 m/s, 2 min), (40 m/s, 5 min), (20 m/s, 2 min), (100 m/s, 2 min) are shown.\nWhen the slide velocity is similar to the local tsunami ve- locity, the coupling effects amplify the tsunami in the direc- tion of propagation (Ward, 2001). In the case of Oshima- Oshima, the water depth in the tsunami source area is 0– 2000 m, where the tsunami velocity ranges 0–140 m/s. Hence the propagating submarine landslide may cause cou- pling with tsunami. The slide was thickest (nearly 400 m) at a water depth of around 200 m (Fig. 6), where the tsunami velocity is about 40 m/s. Hence, the landslide propagat-ing at U=40 m/s causes possible coupling with propagating tsunamis and the amplitudes become large.\n7. Conclusions # The 1741 Oshima-Oshima tsunami can be explained to be the result of a partly submarine lateral collapse of the north flank of the Oshima-Oshima volcano. No tectonic earthquake source is required, which is consistent with the lack of evidence for such an earthquake in the historical records. The tsunami heights are computed on two different grids—a 6′′ grid near the source and a 1′ grid for the entire Japan Sea. A parameter search for the simple kinematic landslide model indicates that the observed values are best explained for the combination of U=40 m/s and T=2 min. The slide velocity is similar to the tsunami phase velocity in the source area, indicating that landslide and tsunamis were coupled to generate the large tsunami heights. The large vertical drop of the slide, from the surface of the water to the deep seafloor, was also responsible for creating the large tsunamis.\nThe simple kinematic landslide model predicts a larger tsunami in the northern direction than what was observed in the southern and western directions. Future studies on this tsunami may include more realistic dynamic modeling for debris avalanches and a search for tsunami deposits on the coasts of Hokkaido and Okushiri Island as well as historical records in Russian and Chinese archives across the Japan Sea.\nAcknowledgments. # The reviews provided by Simon Day and Tadahide Ui were very helpful in improving the manuscript.

Morita Therapy has received increasing international interest over the decades, and the first randomized controlled trial of Morita Therapy to be published outside of China has recently demonstrated the promise of the approach in treating Western patients. To respond to the resulting interest in Morita Therapy from patients and practitioners, and facilitate further Morita Therapy research, it is necessary to provide the detailed explanation of Morita Therapy which is currently rare in the West. In this article, we fill this gap with a thorough description of Morita Therapy in terms of the key principles, objectives and processes of the approach; its basis in Eastern philosophy and naturalism; its sociohistorical context and development over a wide range of formats, patient conditions, and countries. To enable Western practitioners to appreciate and capitalize on the potential value of Morita Therapy as a distinct alternative for patients, we illustrate the approach’s unique method and objective compared to Western psychotherapies, and provide recommendations for practitioners applying Morita Therapy across cultures.\n✉︎ Holly V. R. Sugg h.v.r.sugg@exeter.ac.uk\nIntroduction # Morita Therapy, a Japanese psychotherapy developed by Dr Shōma Morita in 1919, is a holistic, experiential approach which aims to re-orientate patients in nature (Morita 1998). With a focus on allowing suffering as it is, and unpleasant thoughts and emotions conceptualized as natural and uncontrollable phenomena, Morita Therapy contrasts with the focus of established Western approaches on symptom reduction and control (Krech 2014).\nDespite a grounding in Eastern philosophy and Japan’s distinctive culture, Morita Therapy has received increasing international interest and the first published randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Morita Therapy in English-speaking countries has recently demonstrated the promise of the approach for UK patients (Sugg et al. 2018). Thus, for the first time, rigorous empirical data on the application of Morita Therapy in the West is available, and there is increasing interest in the approach worldwide.\nThe purpose of this article is to provide the necessary in-depth explanation of Morita Therapy which is currently rare in the West. Firstly, we present the core features of the approach, including key principles, objectives, and processes, alongside illustrating how these differ to Western psychotherapies. Secondly, we explain the philosophical context of Morita Therapy. Finally, we describe the development and diversity of Morita Therapy over different formats, patient conditions and countries, and provide recommendations for practitioners applying the approach across cultures.\nCore Features of Morita Therapy # Key Principles # Nature # It can be argued that modern humans, in their estrangement from nature, often seek to challenge, conquer, and control nature, essentially living in opposition to it (Fujita 1986; Morton 2017). ‘Nature’ here does not refer only to an isolated notion of the natural world as distinct from humans, but more broadly to the reality of all phenomena, encompassing both the environment and human nature (Fujita 1986; Morita 1998). Morita Therapy seeks to redress this ultimately self-defeating imbalance, by moving patients from an unnatural, inauthentic state to a natural, authentic state in which they live in harmony with the natural world, accepting the body and mind’s natural reactions to life rather than resisting the inevitable cycles and fluctuations of (human) nature (Kitanishi 2005; Morita 1998).\nHuman Nature # All phenomena, including those of the mind and body, are constantly in flux: as humans are always interacting with their environments, their thoughts and emotions shift accordingly (Fujita 1986; Morita 1998; Ogawa 2007). Thus, all emotions are natural, integral, legitimate, and unavoidable experiences conceptualized only as pleasant or unpleasant (desired or undesired) but not as positive or negative (Minami 2013; Reynolds 1976). Indeed, these responses are functional: the mind and emotions shift in order to adapt to situations; ultimately, anxiety and pain are necessary for survival (Fujita 1986; Kora 1995; Morita 1998). As such, all emotions allow life to flow in a balanced way, as long as they are not intellectually judged as either ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ (Kondo 1975).\nAnalogous to the natural world, these responses cannot be controlled or manipulated by will (Ogawa 2007). Instead, Morita noted that all emotions will naturally dissipate, if left to do so (‘the law of emotion’) (Kora 1995; Morita 1998). According to Morita, as emotions cannot be controlled, people are not considered responsible for them; conversely, behaviour is considered controllable, and people responsible for taking the action which needs to be taken, regardless of accompanying emotions (Morita 1998; Ogawa 2007).\nArugamama # Arugamama (literally, ‘as it is’) means to accept things as they are: to concede to phenomenological reality and obey nature (Morita 1998; Ogawa 2007; Reynolds 1976). This is not an intellectually-induced state of acceptance, but an embodied, empirical, intuitive state in which one is immersed in action, has no awareness of the self as set apart from nature, and thus no self-consciousness and resulting difficulties (Kitanishi 2005; LeVine 1998). As such, the authentic experience of the self is accepted as such without judgement or resistance (Ishiyama 2011; Kora 1995). This empowers people to adapt to life with spontaneity and flexibility, taking necessary action whilst allowing the natural ebb and flow of thoughts and emotions (Kora 1995; Ogawa 2007).\nDesire for Life # This concept refers to a natural and fundamental appetite for self-improvement and self-actualisation, comparable to the humanistic notion of a life-propelling inner force: an innate, purposive drive to strive and preserve life (Fujita 1986; Kondo 1975; Kora 1995; Morita 1998). This inherent intelligence and energy strives for the optimal health which results when the body, mind, and emotions are allowed to flow naturally (Ogawa 2007). Thus, Morita therapists do not teach patients how to live meaningful lives, but rather help them to remove the obstacles to their intuitive desire to do so.\nWith desire for life comes an inevitable fear of death: desire and fear are two sides of the same coin (Minami 2013; Morita 1998). For example, a desire to be accepted by others may manifest in feelings of social anxiety. Therefore, the stronger one’s desire towards self-fulfilment, the more likely one is to experience self-concern and disappointment (Ogawa 2013). Thus, desire both propels one to live, and causes suffering, due to the discrepancy between the ideal (desired state) and the realities of life (Kitanishi 2005; Morita 1998; Ogawa 2007). Suffering, therefore, does not indicate a deficit, but an excess: a key concept in counteracting feelings of inadequacy (Kitanishi 2005; Morita 1998; Reynolds 1976).\nPsychopathology # As suffering is considered a natural phenomenon originating from desire for life, problems stem not from suffering itself but from a fixation on and resistance to suffering (Fujita 1986; Morita 1998; Ogawa 2013). Thus, it is the lack of naturalness, the distortion of the arugamama attitude, which is believed to cause difficulties (Fujita 1986). This is conceptualized as a misdirection of desire for life; a squandering of energy through futile efforts to eliminate unpleasant thoughts and emotions (Kora 1995; Ogawa 2007).\nThe Vicious Cycle # Two self-defeating components, Toraware and Hakarai, are conceptualized as producing a vicious cycle which exacerbates suffering (henceforth referred to as ‘the vicious cycle’) (Morita 1998). Toraware (mental preoccupation with symptoms) is characterized by: attentional fixation on symptoms, resulting in rumination and sensitivity to symptoms and perpetuating a cycle of increased distress and fixation (Morita 1998; Ogawa 2013); and the contradiction between ideal and real: a perceived discrepancy between how things should be and how they are (expressed in a perfectionist, unrealistic, judgemental, and dogmatic worldview and/or self-image), which leads to a conditional acceptance of experiences, the self, and the world, and to the labelling of thoughts and emotions as positive or negative, rather than experiencing them only as they are (Kora 1995; Minami 2013).\nHakarai encapsulates futile attempts to control or remove these otherwise natural experiences, which maintain attention on and further aggravate them, impeding the mind and body’s capacity to dissipate them according to their natural course (Minami 2013). These efforts may be made cognitively, such as wilful attempts to suppress emotion, or behaviourally, such as activities undertaken to escape emotion (Nakamura et al., 2010).\nKey Objectives # The overarching objective of Morita Therapy is to cultivate arugamama by removing the distortion of this attitude caused by the vicious cycle (Fujita 1986; Morita 1998; Nakamura et al. 2010). The process is also intended to restore, and foreground attention on, desire for life: through building tolerance and acceptance of suffering, patients shift from being directed by this to being directed by the desires underlying it, re-channelling their energy into purposeful action which fulfils such desires (Fujita 1986; Reynolds 1976). Patients’ conduct therefore becomes dictated by external reality rather than internal states; patients move from being self-oriented to being reality-oriented (Kora 1995; Krech 2014).\nWhen patients reduce engagement in the vicious cycle and shift attention to everyday life, symptoms naturally reduce as a by-product of more meaningful and constructive living (Kora 1995; Nakamura et al. 2010; Ogawa 2013). However, the purpose of Morita Therapy is not to eliminate suffering or symptoms: given Morita’s mechanisms of psychopathology, such attempts are counter-productive (Minami 2013). Thus, in contrast to Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) (Beck 2011) and Behavioural Activation (BA) (Lewinsohn et al. 1976), Morita Therapy does not seek to reduce symptoms through imparting techniques or modifying thought and/or behavioural patterns. Indeed, whilst other approaches all intervene in the experience of symptoms in some form (challenging thoughts; scheduling activities; meditation; cognitive reappraisal), the Morita Therapy method is specifically non-intervention in symptoms (or nature) (Minami 2013). Any attempts to intervene are considered part of the vicious cycle (‘Hakarai’) (Minami 2013), thus differentiating Morita’s vicious cycle from comparable conceptualisations in other treatments.\nKey Processes # Overall, Morita therapists help patients to re-establish contact with nature, cultivating an allowance of their own authentic human nature with its natural ebb and flow of emotion. More specifically, therapists facilitate patients’ understanding of the vicious cycle, capacity to be with symptoms, and engagement in purposeful action (Minami 2013).\nFumon # Illustrating their non-interventional stance, therapists implement Fumon (selective non-response, or strategic inattention) in response to patients’ expression of complaints, to shift patients’ attention away from symptoms and towards purposeful action (Nakamura et al. 2010). Thus, therapists do not dwell on patients’ symptoms, nor attempt to elucidate reasons for suffering, beyond stressing the naturalness of all emotions, explaining how the vicious cycle operates for the individual, and highlighting specific desires underlying fears (Nakamura et al. 2010; Ogawa 2013). Nonetheless, in outpatient treatment therapists do initially enquire into a patient’s symptoms sufficiently to elicit how they engage in the vicious cycle; for example, therapists may respond to a patient’s description of experiencing symptoms by asking where their attention is at that time (to ascertain attentional fixation) and what they do at such times (to ascertain ‘Hakarai’) (Nakamura et al. 2010).\nRest # Traditionally, Morita Therapy begins with bed rest, taking a restorative approach to allow natural healing (Kitanishi 2005; Minami 2013; Morita 1998). Thus, therapists ask patients to ‘be with’ unpleasant thoughts and emotions without attempting to fight or control them, for anything between multiple thirty minute periods (in some outpatient settings) to approximately 1 week (inpatient settings) (LeVine 1993; Morita 1998).\nBy thus eliminating external stimuli and the need to confront suffering, the vicious cycle is thought to be broken: patients experience the ebb and flow of thoughts and emotions running their natural course (Fujita 1986; Kora 1995; Morita 1998). Paradoxically, rest is understood to begin the process of diminishing self-centredness with increased self-focus: patients eventually reach a state of ennui and begin to redirect their attention from introversion (self-preoccupation and fixation on symptoms) to extroversion (ecological awareness and purposeful behaviour) (LeVine 1993; Morita 1998; Ogawa 2013; Reynolds 1976). Accordingly, the patient’s spontaneous desire to do, motivated by desire for life, is heightened, at which stage patients move onto action-taking (Kora 1995; Morita 1998).\nAction-Taking # Following rest, therapists facilitate patients’ movement through three stages of action-taking: (1) light monotonous activities; (2) purposeful activities; (3) social reintegration (Morita 1998; Ogawa 2013). Over the stages, patients’ spontaneity and engagement with others, objects, and nature are increased (LeVine 1998). Patients move onto the next stage according to their readiness to undertake more demanding activities, engagement in nature and action versus engagement in the vicious cycle, and awareness of the natural ebb and flow of thoughts and emotions (Minami 2013; Morita 1998).\nStage one involves light repetitive tasks (usually using the hands) which absorb patients’ attention, engage their senses, stimulate their desire for life, and engage them in nature where possible (Minami 2013; Morita 1998). For example, patients may engage in knitting, tending to pets, and light gardening. Stage two involves purposeful and necessary tasks which are more challenging and practical (using whole body movements), cultivating patients’ capacity to undertake such activities in the presence of symptoms (‘anxious action-taking’) (Minami 2013; Morita 1998). The nature of these activities depends on what is required of patients in their environment, and may include cleaning, larger gardening projects and more strenuous exercise. Stage three involves applying Morita Therapy principles to more social tasks and larger life events, and may involve resuming or changing employment, or re-establishing interpersonal relationships (Minami 2013; Morita 1998).\nIn facilitating action-taking, therapists encourage patients to follow their curiosity and desires, and “ ‘jump into doing’ what is immediate and necessary” within their environment (Ogawa 2013) (p.64). In contrast to BA and CBT, whilst therapists can collaboratively identify tasks with patients which fulfil the criteria for each stage, they are not directive in activity scheduling and/or prior goal discrimination. Instead, action-taking comes about naturally and spontaneously through the inherent purposefulness of desire for life: patients are driven by self-actualising desires and tackling necessary tasks in the moment, rather than their tolerance built up through habituation and/or meeting pre-determined goals (which are avoided in Morita Therapy) (Ogawa 2007). Furthermore, the success of action-taking is not assessed in terms of its impact on symptoms: living a purposeful life in spite of symptoms is the success (Fujita 1986). Thus, action-taking is not a means to an end, but is the end itself.\nThrough immersion in action and shifting of attention to the external environment, patients continue to experience how thoughts and emotions naturally ebb and flow if left alone (Fujita 1986). Indeed, it is understood that patients’ attentional fixation on their symptoms is dissipated (Morita 1998) and they move beyond conscious processing of the self: they “forget anxious thoughts and feelings and become one with action” (Ishiyama 1986) (p.379). Morita Therapy thus minimises the subjective self, inducing a ‘mindless’ state in which one is fully absorbed in the present moment (Morita 1998; Ogawa 2013). This contrasts mindfulness-based approaches, which may be seen to magnify the subjective self: increasing self-awareness in order to shift subjective experiences (potentially increasing self-focus and a fixation on emotional experience from the Morita Therapy perspective).\nDiaries # During therapy, patients complete daily diary entries about their experiences of the day, on which therapists comment (Kora 1995; LeVine 1998). In their comments, as in outpatient therapy sessions, therapists recognise patients’ symptoms as natural experiences (often using natural world metaphors, such as comparing the uncontrollable nature of fluctuations in mood to those in the weather); point out attempts to fight or control inevitable emotions, and contradictions between ideal and real; reframe unpleasant thoughts and emotions as desires; and reinforce patients’ awareness of the external environment, and engagement in action and nature (Minami 2013; Nakamura et al. 2010). Therapists maintain the Fumon stance and thus, unlike in a typical BA or CBT diary, do not analyse the links between action and symptoms, nor the impact of action on mood. For example, a therapist may respond to a patient’s description of going for a walk outside and resulting improvement in mood with the following comments: “You have engaged in purposeful activity and picked up on the natural ebb and flow of emotions here. What did you notice outside?”.\nExperiential Learning # The aim of Morita Therapy is not for patients to receive persuasive counselling, but to incorporate persuasive experiences, which are considered to bring a deeper level of insight than intellectual learning (LeVine 1993; Morita 1998; Ogawa 2013). Whilst approaches which emphasize specific techniques and rational understanding of emotions may be seen to intellectualize emotions, Morita Therapy thus de-intellectualizes emotions, holding that it is the very application of the intellect to emotions which perpetuates the vicious cycle through misinterpretation and over-analysis (Iwata 2019).\nThrough a process akin to experiential re-education, Morita Therapy patients organically discover the transient nature of emotions, and their ability to tolerate them (Fujita 1986; Morita 1998). As such, they develop intuitive, empirically-based, and embodied understandings of natural rhythms, and the futility of resisting them: “the quality of non-resistance” (Krech 2014) (p. 39). They thus move towards arugamama; a state in which patients accept and live in harmony with nature, including their authentic human nature.\nThus, although other approaches such as Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) (Segal et al. 2002) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) (Hayes et al. 1999) also cultivate acceptance, by combining mindfulness with Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) or following a linear process (ACT), the nature of ‘acceptance’ differs. In Morita Therapy, acceptance has a uniquely active, spontaneous, and paradoxical quality: it cannot be brought about through cognitively reappraising symptoms, only through direct behavioural experience and bodily engagement with nature (Fujita 1986; Morita 1998; Ogawa 2013; Watts 1961).\nMorita Therapy is thus qualitatively different to established Western approaches. Whilst other approaches may appear comparable in aim (e.g. acceptance) and certain processes (e.g. action-taking), they miss the phenomenological essence of Morita Therapy: a reorientation in nature through behavioural experience alone, and with that an embodied (de-intellectualized) acceptance of thoughts and emotions as natural phenomena (Tseng 2005).\nPhilosophical and Cultural Context # Morita Therapy is closely tied to the philosophical concepts and cultural values of the distinctive milieu in which it was developed (Fujita 1986). To facilitate a full understanding of Morita Therapy, therefore, relevant contextual information is outlined below.\nTraditional Eastern and Western Worldviews # The dominant Western epistemology emphasizes rationally applying the intellect in line with dichotomous divisions (i.e. reason/emotion; mind/body; subject/object) (Murase and Johnson 1974; Williams 2001). This dualistic thinking encourages a conceptual distinction between humans and nature: nature is objectified and studied through scientific techniques which approach it as separate from humans; humans are understood as autonomous individuals who observe and control the environment (Fujita 1986; Watts 1961). Arguably, this has resulted in a conflict between humans and nature: the Western mind is predisposed to seek to challenge, conquer, and control nature (Fujita 1986; Morton 2017; Tseng 2005).\nIn contrast, Eastern thought is considered holistic, intuitive and non-discriminatory (Fujita 1986). Thus, all phenomena are mutually interdependent and understandable only in relation to each other and the context (Brazier 2012; Watts 2012). Accordingly, Eastern philosophy is naturalistic; humans cannot be set apart from nature, and harmony (rather than individualism and conflict) is stressed: humans adapt themselves to nature rather than attempting to adapt nature to themselves (Morton and Olenik 2004; Watts 2012). Whereas in Western culture, man is in the world (the correlator) and ‘nature’ is the verbal reconstruction of the environment (the correlatee) (Morton 2017); in Eastern culture, man is of the world and ‘nature’ is experienced without applying thoughts and words (Watts 2012).\nPhilosophical Systems # Eastern worldviews are entrenched in philosophical systems which emphasize harmonious living with nature (Tseng 2005). For example, both Taoism and Buddhism stress that all phenomena exist as inseparable parts of the universal whole (Watts 2012). For both, nature encompasses a self-determining spontaneity which is balanced by opposing forces and cannot be comprehended intellectually, but only in a state of ‘egolessness’ (Kitanishi 2005; Watts 2012). Indeed, in Buddhism, pain is considered an unavoidable consequence of ‘egocentric’ attachments to transient and illusionary phenomena, such as emotions, and from mistakenly attempting to control these according to one’s will (Kapleau 2000). Thus, both Buddhism and Taoism consider self-centred desire to be the root of suffering, and have at their basis a philosophy of acceptance and nullification: non-interference in the way of nature (or ‘Tao’); consciousness undisturbed by the grasping ego (Blocker and Starling 2010; Kitanishi 2005; Watts 2012).\nConfucianism also emphasizes living in harmony with others, minimising self-centredness, and practical learning (Chen 2001; Fujita 1986). Combined with elements of Taoism and Buddhism, Neo-Confucianism stresses the consistent principle that the inner nature of all things is the same: Buddha-nature in Buddhist terms; human nature as embedded in the Tao in Taoist terms; human heartedness in Confucian terms (Blocker and Starling 2010; Chen 2001; Fujita 1986; Kapleau 2000; Watts 1961). What follows is a belief that human nature is basically benevolent and self-sufficient: every person has the potential to live with satisfaction, and can be trusted to act with authenticity and spontaneity (Tseng 2005).\nIn Japan, Zen Buddhism resulted from interpreting these philosophies through the indigenous Shinto perspective (Morton and Olenik 2004). Characterized by the worship of natural phenomena, Shintoism focuses on celebrating life in the present moment, expressing gratitude and appeasement towards nature, and prioritising actions over thoughts and words (Blocker and Starling 2010; Morton and Olenik 2004). Hence, Zen Buddhism celebrates everyday phenomena in the here and now, by looking at them from a completely different perspective (Blocker and Starling 2010). Zen epitomizes the Buddhist distrust of language and cognition, which creates an illusion of permanent and independent phenomena, with a distinctively practical focus on holistic and direct experience through meditation and koans (paradoxical questions) (Kapleau 2000; Suzuki 1961; Watts 1961).\nRelationship to Suffering and Healing # These epistemological and philosophical traditions influence how suffering and healing are understood, with approaches to mental health grounded in them (Busfield 2001; Fujita 1986). From a Western rational viewpoint, a dualism exists between reason and emotion: emotions are considered unreasonable, and often pathologized; to be rational (ideal) is to be in control of oneself, including one’s emotions (Williams 2001). Eastern thought rejects these dualisms, understanding reason and emotion as embodied and mutually constituted, and unpleasant emotions as authentic and natural rather than pathological and to be controlled (Williams 2001).\nSecondly, considered key to Western culture and embedded in dichotomous thought are prevailing ideologies of happiness: in ‘the pursuit of happiness’, people seek to experience the pleasant and eliminate suffering, focusing on the future, to when this may be attained (Flora 2009; Tseng 2005; Williams 2001). As such, Western patients are likely to operate in the realm of the ego, focus on the ways things ought to be, and seek manipulation of their phenomenological world through symptom control or elimination, as if symptoms were detachable entities for which a ‘cure’ can be sought (Reynolds 1976; Watts 2012).\nIn contrast, Eastern thought understands apparently opposite emotions as mutually interdependent: one cannot experience happiness without sadness (Watts 2012). As such, the focus is shifted from future goals and what ought to be, to the present, to what is: emotions, the self, and reality are accepted without resistance, allowing them to run their natural course in line with the Tao, in which moments of happiness spontaneously come and go, and to pursue them is to miss the experience itself (Kitanishi 2005; Reynolds 1976; Watts 2012). The spontaneity of Eastern naturalness specifically denotes a path of non-pursuit and non-interference: it is an inner resistance to symptoms, rather than symptoms themselves, which must be ‘cured’ (Blocker and Starling 2010; Reynolds 1976; Watts 1961).\nEastern Philosophy Reflected in Morita Therapy # Although Morita clarified that his therapy was not derived from Buddhism, the convergence between Morita Therapy and Eastern philosophy has been noted by many authors (Kitanishi 2005; LeVine 1998; Ogawa 2007). Morita Therapy clearly incorporates Eastern naturalism in aiming to correct self-centredness through a unity of mind, body, and nature, expressed and experienced through action, whereby one harmonizes with nature by adapting to phenomenological reality (Fujita 1986; Kitanishi 2005; Morita 1998). Accordingly, Morita’s approach is holistic, focusing on the whole person rather than their symptoms (Morita 1998; Nakamoto 2010), and the Zen ideology of egolessness is key to Morita Therapy: a state in which attention moves freely from one external event to another without conscious self-evaluation (Ishiyama 1986; Kitanishi 2005; LeVine 1998).\nBoth Zen and Morita affirm desires and conflicts: Morita Therapy stresses the necessity of opposites and that suffering is an integral and inevitable consequence of desire (Kitanishi 1992, 2005; Tseng 2005). Both stress that thoughts and emotions need not cause difficulties unless they are intellectually evaluated as good or bad, inciting attempts to cling to or banish them (Kapleau 2000; Kondo 1975). As epitomized in Zen meditation, Morita Therapy thus emphasizes non-interference in the natural flow of thoughts and emotions through ego mechanisms such as rationalisation, resistance, and attachment (in essence, Morita’s vicious cycle) (Kapleau 2000; Reynolds 1976; Watts 1961). In accordance with Zen meditation and the paradoxical nature of intense self-enquiry within koan practice, the Morita Therapy rest stage is thought to diminish this egocentric thinking through facilitating a widening of awareness (Kapleau 2000; LeVine 1998).\nIt is understood that once such ego mechanisms are broken down, natural energies are liberated, and adaptability and spontaneity become possible: key to both Zen enlightenment and arugamama (Kitanishi 1992; Reynolds 1976; Suzuki 1961). Such spontaneity is, in Morita Therapy, characterized by free-flowing desire for life, unimpeded by self-consciousness: a concept akin to Buddha-nature, human nature within the Tao, and Confucian human-heartedness, all suggesting an innate authenticity which provides the means and drive to live a meaningful life (Brazier 2012; Chen 2001; Fujita 1986; Ogawa 2007).\nBoth Morita Therapy and Zen stress putting principles into everyday practice, focusing outwardly on tasks, and losing the self in productive effort (Kapleau 2000; Kitanishi 1992). Similarly, neo-Confucianism holds that “knowledge becomes genuine knowledge by means of action” (Fujita 1986) (p. 39). Morita’s focus on experience, and distrust of language and cognition, also conforms to Eastern viewpoints, epitomising Zen (Kapleau 2000; Kitanishi 1992; Murase and Johnson 1974; Watts 2012). Through directly experiencing bodily activities in relation to the environment, the (illusionary) dualism between self and the world is considered to fall away (LeVine 1998; Morita 1998; Nakamoto 2010; Reynolds 1976; Watts 1961). Thus, both Zen and Morita target not the intellect but the phenomenology of existence: what it feels like to be alive (Watts 1961).\nDevelopment and Diversity of Morita Therapy # Sociohistorical Context # Following national isolation in Japan, the 1868 Meiji Restoration effected significant sociological change as communication with the West increased (Morton and Olenik 2004; Nishizono 2005). The corresponding ‘Westernisation’ of Japan created a sense of cultural dissonance, as attempts were made to combine Japanese traditions and Eastern worldviews with Western systems and science (Blocker and Starling 2010; Fujita 1986; Nishizono 2005).\nAccordingly, the traditional holistic spirit of harmonious integration with nature was brought into conflict with dichotomous and rationalistic Western ideologies which approach nature as an isolated object to be controlled (Fujita 1986; Kitanishi 2005). Furthermore, the competitive nature of industry and emphasis on individualism contrasted the traditional Japanese family consciousness and attitude of self-inhibiting sensitivity to others (Blocker and Starling 2010; Fujita 1986; Kondo 1975; Nishizono 2005). It was in the context of these conflicts between traditional and modern values, and the neuroses they were understood to produce, that Morita developed his therapy (Fujita 1986; Nishizono 2005; Ogawa 2013).\nMorita Therapy Formats # Inpatient Treatment # Morita Therapy was originally developed as a structured inpatient treatment in Morita’s own home, including the four successive stages of rest and action-taking described above. A number of inpatient clinics still operate in Japan as well as China (Jiangbo 2000; Ogawa 2013), whilst the only inpatient clinic in English-speaking countries operates in Australia (LeVine 1993). There is much variation in the practices of contemporary clinics, particularly in terms of how broadly Morita’s theory is interpreted and applied to different patient conditions; the degree to which they implement Fumon; and the extent to which they emphasize nature, insight, rest, work, recreational activity, and/or the relationship between Morita Therapy and Zen Buddhism (Ogawa 2013; Reynolds 1976).\nOutpatient Treatment # Outpatient Morita Therapy is applied in a diverse range of settings throughout Japan and elsewhere (Kitanishi 2005; Minami 2013; Reynolds 1976). Accordingly, the Japanese Society for Morita Therapy developed outpatient guidelines to summarize core components (available in English) (Nakamura et al. 2010). These guidelines are variably applied, perhaps due to the absence of a systematic Morita Therapy education system or widely accepted manual (Ogawa 2013). Current outpatient methods range from staged approaches (e.g. LeVine 1993; Sugg et al. 2017) to counselling approaches with no such structure, such as the active counselling method (e.g. Ishiyama 2011), and include group-based (e.g. Ashizawa et al. 2000), psychosocial (e.g. Minami 2016) and psychoeducational (e.g. Semenova 2016) interventions.\nConditions Treated with Morita Therapy # Morita Therapy was developed to treat ‘Shinkeishitsu’: a term developed by Morita (Kitanishi et al. 2002). Shinkeishitsu is considered to correspond to DSM-V (American Psychiatric Association 2013) anxiety disorders, alongside elements of mood and personality disorders, and is characterized by strong desires for success and social approval and related fears: such people tend to be introspective, perfectionist, self-conscious, and self-critical (Kitanishi et al. 2002; Ogawa 2013).\nMorita considered Shinkeishitsu processes to be present to some degree in everyone: all possess desire for life to which Morita’s mechanisms of psychopathology relate (Fujita 1986; Morita 1998). Thus, Morita Therapy is considered relevant wherever patients resist suffering and, with it, their authentic and natural selves (Fujita 1986; Kitanishi 2005). Accordingly, Morita Therapy is now applied to a diverse range of conditions including a range of anxiety disorders, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, eating disorders, borderline personality, trauma, chronic pain, and with victims of sexual assault, cancer patients and civil war victims and perpetrators (Ashizawa et al. 2000; Iwata 2019; Jia et al. 2018; Minami 2016; Ogawa 2013, 1988; Sugg et al. 2018).\nInternational Developments # Morita Therapy is now practiced in Australia, China, North America, Russia, Rwanda, South Korea and Taiwan, predominantly by a small number of Japanese practitioners (e.g. Ishiyama 1986; Minami 2016; Ogawa 2013). In English-speaking countries, inpatient and outpatient treatment are provided in Australia (LeVine 1998), and outpatient counselling-based methods in North America (e.g. Ishiyama 1986; Ogawa 1988). In addition, ideas from Morita Therapy and another Japanese approach consisting of intensive reflection on past experiences (Naikan Therapy) have been modified and combined to form ‘Constructive Living’ in North America (Reynolds 1995).\nThe first published randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Morita Therapy in English-speaking countries has recently been completed: a UK-based pilot RCT of outpatient Morita Therapy versus treatment as usual for depression (Sugg et al. 2018). Morita Therapy was delivered in the University of Exeter AccEPT Clinic by two therapists trained in the UK Morita Therapy outpatient protocol (Sugg et al. 2017). Of the 68 participants recruited, 66.7% of those receiving Morita Therapy responded to treatment, compared to 13.3% in treatment as usual. Further bolstered by an embedded qualitative study which highlighted the value and impact of Morita Therapy for many participants (Sugg et al. 2019), these results demonstrate the promise of Morita Therapy in treating UK-based patients.\nIssues in the Cross-cultural Application of Morita Therapy # Given the grounding of Morita Therapy in Eastern naturalism and Japan’s distinctive culture, some authors argue that considerable modifications to the approach are necessary to achieve cultural accommodation in the West (Ishiyama 1994; Ogawa 2013; Ohara 1990; Reynolds 1989). Particular concerns relate to rest, Fumon, the translation of Zen terms into English, and Westerners’ receptivity to accepting rather than controlling symptoms (Kondo 1998; LeVine 1998; Ogawa 2013; Reynolds 1989). Indeed, Reynolds modified the approach for a North American context by extracting and assimilating elements of Morita Therapy into what was considered a more Western-appropriate treatment (Reynolds 1989).\nHowever, accompanying such modifications are concerns that the essential, defining elements of Morita Therapy are being displaced (LeVine 1998; Ohara 1990). Authors challenge the degree to which Reynolds truly adopts Morita’s principles, note concerns around the potential misuse of Morita Therapy across cultures, and strongly urge those adapting Morita Therapy to respect its theory and goals (Kondo 1998; LeVine 1998; Ogawa 2013). Specifically, it is recommended that therapists preserve the four stage structure (intensive rest; light monotonous activities; purposeful activities; social reintegration) as central to the defining progressive and experiential nature of Morita Therapy; focus on facilitating patients’ experiences, rather than relying on the verbal approaches and abstract knowledge which Morita precisely warned against; and maintain Fumon (inattention to symptoms) whilst portraying empathy and elucidating the mechanisms of the vicious cycle for the individual (Kondo 1998; LeVine 1998; Nakamura et al. 2010; Ogawa 2013).\nAccordingly, in our UK trial, we strictly adhered to the philosophical and experiential basis of Morita Therapy (including the four stages and Fumon) (Sugg et al. 2017, 2018). Our data on treatment response and adherence indicate that, in general, this version of Morita Therapy may be as beneficial for a Western population as other psychotherapies (Sugg et al. 2018). Furthermore, our qualitative findings suggest that some patients specifically appreciate the unique components of Morita Therapy (e.g. rest; Fumon) and highly value the focus on allowing (as opposed to controlling) symptoms as natural phenomena, often in strong preference to other therapies they have tried (Sugg et al. 2019).\nThus, that Morita Therapy challenges some fundamental assumptions of Western culture by offering an alternative philosophical basis for approaching mental health may be exactly what gives Morita Therapy value for Western patients and practitioners, particularly those expressing discontent with Western approaches to psychiatry (Coulter and Willis 2004; Miles 2009). Indeed, as a unique experiential approach which moves beyond the acceptance of symptoms to the reorientation of patients in nature, Morita Therapy has the potential to offer Western patients a distinct alternative to established treatments, thereby facilitating patient choice and the matching of individuals to their most suitable treatment option (Cuijpers and Christensen 2017).\nConclusion # Morita Therapy is a Japanese psychotherapy which moves patients towards a position of accepting and living in harmony with nature, including the emotional fluctuations of their own authentic human nature, through a process of rest and action-taking. As a holistic, experiential and non-interventional approach with a phenomenological focus which moves beyond the acceptance of symptoms to the reorientation of patients in nature, Morita therapy differs from established Western psychotherapies in its methods and objectives. Although Morita Therapy is grounded in Eastern naturalism and Japan’s distinctive culture, the approach has received increasing international interest over the decades. The first published randomized controlled trial of Morita Therapy in English-speaking countries demonstrates the promise of Morita Therapy in treating Western patients, and indicates that Morita Therapy may not require as much modification to achieve cultural accommodation in the West as previously suggested. Indeed, we recommend that the original methods of Morita Therapy are adhered to in applying the approach across cultures, including the four stages of rest and action-taking, Fumon stance, focus on experiential learning, and allowance of the self and symptoms as part of the natural ecology of human experience. When the defining philosophical and experiential basis of Morita Therapy is thus preserved, the approach has potential value in providing Western patients with a distinct alternative to current treatments.\nReferences # American Psychiatric Association.

It remains unknown how this reemergence occurred, specifically if local populations have been overlooked at low densities or if the species has successfully spread across the highly fragmented anthropogenic landscape. In the central German Rhön Mountains, for instance, wildcats were believed to be extinct during most of the twentieth century, however, the species was recently detected and subsequent genetic monitoring found the presence of a sizeable population. In this study, we used microsatellite and SNP genotypes from 146 wildcat individuals from 2008 to 2017 across a ~ 15,000 km2 area in the central German low mountain region to understand the population re-establishment of wildcats in the region. Bayesian clustering and subsequent analyses revealed that animals in the Rhön Mountains appear to be a mix from the two adjacent populations in the North and South of the area, suggesting a recent range expansion from two different directions. Both populations meet in the Rhön Biosphere Reserve, leading to an admixture of the northern, autochthonous, and the southern reintroduced wildcat population. While we cannot completely exclude the possibility of undetected population persistence, the high genetic homogeneity in the central German wildcat population and the lack of any signatures of past population decline in the Rhön favor a scenario of natural expansion. Our findings thus suggest that wildcats are well capable of rapid range expansion across richly structured landscape mosaics consisting of open land, settlements, and forest patches and document the potential of massive non-invasive genetic sampling when aiming to reconstruct the complex population and range dynamics of wildlife. Introduction # Many populations of large- and medium-sized carnivores are currently re-expanding their ranges across the densely populated and anthropogenically modified landscapes of central Europe (Chapron et al. 2014). These altered landscapes exhibit high levels of habitat fragmentation, which is the disruption of continuous stretches of suitable habitat (Schadt et al. 2002). Habitat fragmentation can negatively affect the viability of populations and species. However, the extent to which species are affected varies significantly (Haddad et al. 2015). A species’ reaction to cultural landscapes depends heavily on the size of suitable habitat, the distance between habitat patches, and the individual species’ life history traits (Caruso et al. 2016). Carnivores, for instance, are at a heightened risk of being negatively impacted in fragmented landscapes due to their relatively large home ranges and low population densities (Crooks 2002; Noss et al. 1996; Woodroffe 1998). Therefore, investigating how carnivores successfully disperse and establish viable populations in altered landscapes is important to understand the potential for long-term existence of wildlife in human-dominated landscapes (Riley et al. 2003).\nThe European wildcat is a flagship species for nature conservation in Germany, as it primarily relies on highly structured natural deciduous and mixed forests (Driscoll and Nowell 2010). This reliance on connected forests has made it a pillar for the preservation of natural habitats. Recently, the wildcat has made a reemergence across the central German low mountain region (Steyer et al. 2016), providing a relevant example to understand dispersal dynamics in a highly fragmented landscape.\nHistorically, European wildcat populations were heavily depleted due to human persecution until the early twentieth century. In Germany, the species was restricted to few refugial areas within the low mountain region, such as the Pfälzerwald, Eifel, and the Harz Mountains (Eckert et al. 2010). After hunting pressure was reduced, distance between refugial areas, habitat fragmentation, and increasing anthropogenic development left local wildcat populations geographically isolated (Hille et al. 2000; Pierpaoli et al. 2003). Considering the possible negative effects of isolated populations, including inbreeding and genetic drift, efforts to connect these distinct wildcat populations have become a conservation priority (Klar et al. 2012; Mattucci et al. 2016). Given the concern for wildcat population connectivity, genetic monitoring relying on hair trapping was established across known wildcat territories (Klar et al. 2008; Simon and Hupe 2008; Steyer et al. 2013). The results of increased monitoring showed strong evidence for the recent recovery of wildcat populations in various areas (Steyer et al. 2013; Steyer et al. 2016). Most recently, the species had been documented in areas distant from the known source regions, such as in the Bayerischer Wald in the Southeast and the Lüneburger Heide in Northern Germany (unpublished data). These new detections of the species in areas outside long-standing refugia and reintroduction sites suggest that the wildcat is capable of rapid dispersal and establishment across anthropogenically modified landscapes (scenario 1). However, it remains unknown if the species may have persisted in small, overlooked populations that are now increasing locally (scenario 2). Revealing the origin of wildcat reemergence is of considerable importance, especially considering the first scenario, expansion from refugia and reintroduction areas, which would imply that effective dispersal and population establishment of mobile mammals such as wildcats may be less obstructed by habitat fragmentation and barriers within anthropogenic landscapes than previously assumed (Klar et al. 2008; Jerosch et al. 2018; Balkenhol and Waits 2009).\nHere, we aim to disentangle the above-mentioned recolonization scenarios by investigating the fine-scale genetic population structure of wildcats in a region where the species was recently detected, namely the Rhön Biosphere Reserve (RBR). The RBR is located on the southeastern edge of published wildcat distribution in the central low mountain region (Fig. 1) (Klar et al. 2009). The RBR is a biodiversity-rich landscape, dominated by meadows and open land, surrounded by multiple large highways (A7, A71, A4) (Jedicke 2013). The RBR is home to a variety of protected species, including the wildcat. Wildcats in the RBR were thought to be extinct during most of the twentieth century until first genetic detections of wildcats occurred between 2007 and 2009 (Birlenbach et al. 2009). Beginning in 2009, under the frame of various monitoring projects (Table S1), the RBR and surroundings were heavily searched for evidence of wildcat, resulting in the detection of a substantial presence of wildcat in this region (Reiners et al. 2014; Thein 2008). Scenario 1 would imply wildcats expanded from adjacent populations into the RBR. Given the regional history, there are two possible source populations; (i) the refugial population in the north and (ii) the reintroduced population in the adjacent Spessart Mountains (Fig. 1). The known wildcat distribution to the north of the RBR was documented since before 2009 as a known source of a stable wildcat population (Birlenbach et al. 2009). The wildcat reintroduction in the Spessart region was launched in 1984 under the frame of a long-term reintroduction project. Approximately 600 wildcats were released until 2008 (Büttner and Worel 1990). Additionally, in 2005, six wildcats were reintroduced in the Neuwirthauser Forest, which is at the southernmost part of the RBR. It remains unknown if this reintroduction was successful and contributed to the reemergence in the RBR or if the current population resembles dispersal of individuals from the north. Scenario 2 would indicate a local increase from a small, overlooked relict population within the Rhön Mountains, which would likely result in population sub-structuring, due to the loss of rare alleles in small isolated populations, indicating the presence that a relict population survived and is now expanding in the low mountain region (Excoffier et al. 2009).\nfigure1 Fig. 1 Map of 146 wildcat samples used for combined SNP and microsatellite approach (blue) and 439 wildcat samples analyzed only with msats (orange) from 2004 to 2017 used for analysis showing the known wildcat distribution (KWD), Rhön Biosphere Reserve (RBR), and Spessart reintroduction (SPR) as well as the forested area based on ATKIS (FOR). Map of the study area is shown in the red box within the inlet Full size image\nThe present study aims to disentangle the two proposed scenarios to shed light on the origin of wildcats in this low mountain region. For this, data was obtained from a large-scale genetic monitoring program conducted over the past 10 years in Germany. From this monitoring program, we genotyped a subset of samples with SNP and microsatellite markers to reveal the genetic makeup in the RBR. We compared the genetic structure of wildcats in the RBR with both adjacent source and reintroduced populations (Steyer et al. 2016) to test the two scenarios explaining the emergence of the species in the RBR given above.\nMaterials and methods # Study site # The study area comprised the Rhön Mountains, including the RBR and surroundings (Fig. 1). The reserve spans over 2433 km2, which was expanded in 2014 to include the southern Rhön with the NF. The Rhön is a low mountain range ranging from 250 to 950 m, with approximately 40% forested land. Within the study area, the closest potential source populations were included; mainly the region surrounding the National Park Hainich in the north, and the Spessart Mountains, bordering the Rhön Mountains to the southwest. The Hainich Mountains range from 225 to 494 m and are the most expansive broad-leaved forest, the primary habitat of the wildcat, in Germany. The Spessart Mountains include one of Germany’s most forested areas, peaking at 586 m. In total, our study consisted of approximately 15,000 km2 of variable habitats.\nSample collection and laboratory methodologies # Multiple opportunistic and standardized monitoring projects collected samples from 2004 to 2017. Opportunistic wildcat roadkill samples were collected throughout the study period. In addition, multiple monitoring projects began in 2008, most notably Rhoen Natur e.V., BUND Wildkatzensprung, and Biosphärenreservat Rhön projects, which resulted in intense monitoring within the RBR during this time (for a complete list, see supplementary Table S1). In this study, we combined microsatellite and SNP genotyping methods. We took 119 wildcat microsatellite genotypes from 2004 to 2013 from a German-wide study on wildcat population structure (Steyer et al. 2016) and added 49 additional genotypes from 2014 to 2017 to be further analyzed using a wildcat specific SNPtype™ marker panel (von Thaden et al. 2020). Microsatellite genotypes were considered for SNP genotyping if they had a minimum of 11 loci and showed amplification success rates of 80%. Additionally, this selection excluded potential hybrids as there are low rates of hybridization across the study area (Steyer et al. 2018). The samples were then selected to create an even distribution in location, time, and sample type. Of the selected genotypes, 64 samples originated from tissue of dead found wildcats, and the remaining 104 samples are hair samples from various monitoring projects.\nWe used the primers LF4 (Eckert et al. 2010) and H16498 (Kocher et al. 1989) to sequence a 110 bp fragment of the mitochondrial control region following the protocol in Steyer et al. (2016). All samples were analyzed using 14 microsatellite markers and a zink finger sex marker (Hartmann et al. 2013). For non-invasively collected samples, the multiple tube approach using three replicates per sample was applied (Hartmann et al. 2013). Individualization was carried out through a custom R script and duplicated individuals were removed before further analysis (see Steyer et al. 2016 for further details). The microsatellite genotypes utilized from the Steyer et al. (2016) study were compared with the samples collected between 2014 and 2017 to look for batch effects. As none was found, the sample sets were combined.\nThe SNP genotyping of wildcat samples (n = 168) was performed on a EP1 platform (Fluidigm Corp., USA) using microfluidic 96.96 Dynamic Arrays™. Detailed methods and wildcat-specific SNPtype™ Assays are presented in von Thaden et al. (2017) and von Thaden et al. (2020). The SNPtype™ marker panel encompasses 84 loci selected for individual and population identification, 10 loci for hybrid detection, and 2 SRY-linked loci. All SNP experiments included four no template controls (NTC) per array and non-invasively collected hair samples were triplicated to detect potential errors. From 168 samples, seven samples did not show sufficient (\u0026gt; 70%) amplification success to be scored and used in downstream analysis. Subsequent individualization resulted in 146 individuals to be analyzed using the combined SNP and microsatellite data.\nData analyses # First, we tested the combined SNP and microsatellite data set for isolation by distance (IBD) effects. We performed an IBD analysis as implemented in GeneAlEx 6.5 (Peakall and Smouse 2012) to account for genetic differentiation solely based on geographical position of individuals. The program STRUCTURE v2.3.4 (Pritchard et al. 2000) was used to evaluate population genetic structure. After 100,000 steps of burn-in, 200,000 MCMC steps were performed with admixture model and correlated allele frequencies using a range of K 1–10 with 10 iterations. We used Structure Harvester (Earl and vonHoldt 2012) with the Evanno method (Evanno et al. 2005) to determine the most likely number of population clusters. The replicates were consolidated with the software CLUMPP (Jakobsson and Rosenberg 2007) using the GREEDY algorithm.\nFurther review of the spatial structure was carried out with the ADEGENET package in R (v.3.4.2) using a spatial principal component analysis (sPCA) (Jombart 2008). No requirements of the data to meet Hardy-Weinberg expectations or linkage equilibrium are needed for this method. In addition to the genetic data, sPCA also uses spatial information and is particularly suitable for the analysis of weak genetic structures (Storfer et al. 2007). sPCA relies on Moran’s I (Moran 1948, 1950) to identify spatial patterns within the genetic structure of the sampled individuals. The method distinguishes between global scores, which indicate gradients in allele frequencies, and local scores, indicating differences in neighboring samples.\nStandard genetic diversity indices including expected and observed heterozygosity, allelic richness, and population pairwise FST values were calculated for the combined SNP and microsatellite genotypes using Arlequin version 3.5.2.2 (Excoffier and Lischer 2010).\nResults # Of the 146 genotyped individuals, mtDNA haplotypes were successfully determined in 134 individuals and corresponded to SNG-HP-FS03/-04/-06/-22/-23 (Steyer et al. 2016). Haplotype SNG-HP-FS23 was found in eight individuals solely in the southern part of the study region (Fig. 2b). The other four haplotypes appeared in all parts of the study area.\nfigure2 Fig. 2 Map showing the spatial genetic structure as assessed by sPCA analysis and haplotype map. a Individual scores from the first principal component: large blue squares indicated a highly positive score, large red squares indicated highly negative scores. b Map of individuals within the study area with the haplotype 23 (red) and all other haplotypes (3, 4, 6, 22) Full size image\nAnalysis of genetic structure based on combined SNP and microsatellite genotypes revealed no evidence of isolation by distance (IBD; Mantel test: r = 0.011, p = 0.48). Bayesian clustering implemented in STRUCTURE indicated K = 2 as the most likely number of clusters within the study area. Separation of these clusters could not be attributed to a geographical pattern, with individuals clearly showing representation from both clusters (Fig. 3).\nfigure3 Fig. 3 STRUCTURE results from K = 2, which was suggested by Structure Harvester as the most likely value from K 1 to 10. Each bar represents a single individual. The coloration corresponds to the estimated proportions of posterior probability assignments of each sample to each cluster Full size image\nClustering with sPCA resulted in a significant global structure, indicating correlation between the genetic and geographic distances (p = 0.01). However, no significant local structure was found (p = 0.14). A plot of lagged scores from the first principal component suggested the global structure is linked to a north-south genetic border, with a transitional area within the RBR (Fig. 2a). Subsequent principal components show weaker genetic structure although the eigenvalues suggest the first principal component explains most of the genetic variance found in wildcat individuals from the study area (Fig. S1).\nStandard measures of genetic diversity were carried out based on the two clusters defined by the sPCA (Table 1). When looking at two clusters, observed (0.41, 0.43) and expected (0.42, 0.43) heterozygosity values from the north and south, respectively, were highly similar. Allelic richness was also identical (2.45, 2.45) along with a comparable fixation index (0.047, 0.011). The RBR, which comprised much of the south cluster, showed no local genetic signature such as higher allelic richness or specific clustering in the region. We also carried out pairwise FST analysis based on the two clusters, which were not significantly differentiated from each other (Table 2). We also compared our dataset with a larger, microsatellite-only sample set of 439 individuals originating from a previous study (Steyer et al. 2016), which revealed some sub-structuring in the south, specifically between the reintroduced region and the RBR (Fig. S2).\nTable 1 Genetic diversity of the wildcats sampled in the study region divided based on sPCA groups.

While the recolonization process has been well documented (Canters et al. 2005; Nussberger et al. 2018; Streif et al. 2017), few attempts have been made to distinguish between active range expansion and locally growing populations. We assessed regional population structure of wildcat based on available samples from various monitoring projects in the region (Table S1). We investigated population sub-structuring and fine-scale genetic diversity to shed light on two possible scenarios for the rapid appearance of wildcats within this low mountain region.\nThe number of wildcat individuals found within the study region between 2009 and 2014 (Fig. 1) indicates the presence of a viable wildcat population within the RBR. In part, this high number of wildcat detections can be attributed to the intense monitoring activities by multiple concurrent projects (Table S1). However, it appears unlikely that the marked increase of wildcat evidence since 2009 can be explained solely by increased monitoring activities. To our knowledge, local experts have continuously looked for wildcat presence in the region, making it unlikely that a population remained undetected for decades in the Rhön (Franz Müller, pers. comm.). Roadkill monitoring has occurred since 2004 rather opportunistically, involving local authorities, conservationists, and hunters. In addition, the overall observed trend of recent wildcat expansion across various regions within Germany (Steyer et al. 2016; Streif et al. 2017; Würstlin et al. 2016) supports the observed pattern of population increase within the study area.\nThe past reintroduction of wildcats in the Spessart allows for tracking possible wildcat expansion in this region through a unique mtDNA haplotype (Steyer et al. 2016). While haplotypes SNG-HP-FS03/-04/-06/-22 are the most common haplotypes in German wildcat populations (Steyer et al. 2016), SNG-HP-FS23 is restricted to the Spessart Mountains (Fig. 2b). While this gives clear indication that reintroduced wildcats have successfully established in the Spessart region, the distribution of this haplotype also documents a lack of substantial spread into the RBR. Our findings of the haplotype SNG-HP-FS23 being largely restricted to the Spessart reintroduction area suggests that the expansion into the Rhön area is mainly driven by male dispersal from the Southern reintroduction area and confirms the general observation of male-dominated dispersal in carnivores (Støen et al. 2005).\nOur results from population structure analysis indicate a highly admixed population that comprises the northern refugial and the reintroduced populations. The sPCA results indicate that wildcats in the northern area of the RBR are genetically indistinguishable from northern refugia, which derive from the central German wildcat population described in Steyer et al. (2016) (Fig. 2a). In addition, the data suggests that wildcats from the reintroduction are moving into the RBR. Interestingly, STRUCTURE results show a highly admixed population with no clear geographic boundaries (Fig. 3). This may be explained by overall weak sub-structuring (FST \u0026lt; 0.05) (Hubisz et al. 2009; Stift et al. 2019). The FST measures also showed no significant deviation between the northern and southern clusters defined by the sPCA. This hints at a highly admixed population throughout the study region.\nWe found no evidence of an overlooked population within the RBR, as no private alleles were discovered in the area and we did not find any genetic sub-structure separating the Rhön from adjacent regions. Thus, the most probable explanation for the observed genetic pattern is a recolonization from both (northern and southern) directions. In case of overall low sub-structure within the central German wildcat population, which has been found previously (Steyer et al. 2016) and is confirmed in this study, a scenario of local population size increase together with significant dispersal from adjacent areas appears feasible. Still, the lack of evidence for wildcat appearance prior to 2008 makes the first option more likely and both scenarios ultimately require substantial dispersal from adjacent regions, suggesting a significant permeability of the landscape for wildcats.\nOur results imply that wildcats can disperse through human-dominated landscapes. Land use within the newly recolonized RBR comprises 41% forested land (Jedicke 2013), with the remaining being settlement, open meadows, or arable land. Our study suggests that wildcats can, within a few years or few generations, recolonize a region with a substantial proportion of open land. This reemergence implies the wildcat is not significantly isolated due to road infrastructure, and can establish home ranges in primarily agricultural habitats, which has been supported by recent studies showing similar results (Jerosch et al. 2017; Jerosch et al. 2018; Klar et al. 2009; Würstlin et al. 2016). The presence of green bridges, built in 2011, potentially facilitates the exchange between individuals on either side of the A7 highway, as has been shown in other regions (Pir et al. 2011). The main factor determining habitat choice in wildcats is thought to be distance to forest (Sarmento et al. 2006). Jerosch et al. (2018) highlight structural heterogeneity in open landscapes as a determining factor allowing wildcats to persist in human-dominated landscapes. Therefore, the presence of rich-structured mosaics of open land and forest patches might have provided suitable conditions for successful recolonization in the RBR.\nOur findings confirm a recolonization process of the wildcat in the Rhön Mountains, which has important implications for current wildcat conservation strategies. The results mainly suggest that connecting suitable habitat through stepping stones of rich-structured patches, rather than continuous forest, may be sufficient for wildcat dispersal. Therefore, it is important to conserve landscapes of rich-structured mosaics of open land and forest patches, similar to the Rhön, as habitat fragmentation continues to occur. As a flagship species, efforts to create heterogeneous landscapes will help other forest-dwelling species to migrate between patches.\nReferences # Balkenhol N, Waits LP (2009) Molecular road ecology: exploring the potential of genetics for investigating transportation impacts on wildlife.
